For me, a daddy to a large family who learned to read with Dr. Seuss and who has memorized too many of the books via repeated readings to young children, Prof. Nel's brilliant 'American Icon' is a long awaited treat. At last a serious treatment of this remarkable genius that is both an engaging read and filled with remarkable insights! I especially enjoyed (and learned more than I care to admit from) Prof. Nel's discussions of the Disneyfication of Seuss - which Nel links to failings in American copyright law, \"the other sides of Dr. Seuss\" - all of which sides were new to me, and the political genesis of his secular morality in the WWII cartoon work he did at PM magazine. The chapters on Geisel's poetry and artwork and the link Nel makes between Seuss and the historical avant guarde alone make this book a \"must buy\" for parents and serious readers, not to mention public libraries. Readers of Nel's other books will find the same engaging writing style that makes the book a fun read while imparting a mountain of information and important ideas. This is simply the best and most comprehensive book yet written on the work of Seuss Geisel and what will certainly be the standard for many years to come. Thank you, Prof. Nel, wherever you are, from a reader who grew up with the good doctor and who is growing up with him again years later. Your book, written from your encyclopeadic knowledge of children's literature and the media of this genre - from scanning verse to cubist painting! - explains the power, limits, and popularity of the Seuss phenomenon.\n",

      "Philip Nel - Dr. Seuss: American IconThis is basically an academic overview of Seuss poetry, art, cartoons, and the problems with the commercialization of the Seuss name and works after his death. It is not, to any real extent, a biography. Those seeking such should move on.As an academic book it leans on the dry side. It assumes the reader has a fairly good knowledge of Children's Literature and 20th Century cartoons (not the animated kind). Not a book to begin your Dr. Seuss experience with. But if you have read them to your children and are interested about the writing style (there is a good chapter about his poetry) or his art style (not as good a chapter, but still interesting).What interested me the most was the deconstruction of the recent rush to \"cash in\" on Seuss by Hollywood and advertisers. I think that Nel wants to come down against it, but based on Seuss' background (he started out drawing Flit ads) and the projects he approved during his lifetime; it is a tough argument to make. In the end though Nel does point out that maybe the movies and tie- ins did not have to be so... crass?The book is well researched; lots of neat tidbits are to be gleamed. Early cartoons by Seuss for PM magazine were occasionally (by today's standards) shockingly racist. It makes him a little more human and puts his latter works like the Lorax in a new light.Those in Education may enjoy this background. Fans of Seuss will enjoy the exhaustive bibliography of Seuss's many, many works. Also good list of other works about the man.\n"

I figured I was in trouble when a typo is prominently featured on the back cover, but the first page of the book removed all doubt. Wait - maybe I'm missing the point. A quick re-read of the beginning now makes it clear. This has to be an intentional churning of over-heated prose for satiric purposes. Phew, so glad I didn't waste $10.95 after all.\n",

As another reviewer points out, there is a misspelling on the cover, and I believe there is at least one per chapter. For example, it was mentioned twice that she had a \"lean\" on her house. I was so distracted by the poor writing and weak plot, that I decided to read with a pencil in hand to mark all of the horrible grammar and spelling. Please don't waste your money. I too, believe that the good reviews must have been written by the author's relatives. I will not put much faith in the reviews from now on!\n"

Very few fans of Feehan's Dark series seem to realize that although this book is not part of the Dark series, is the children and children's children of this couple will tie in to the Dark series later. Bryon's lifemate will come from this line. But if you want to learn about what's going to happen in the future books in this series as well as the Dark series, then go to Feehan's web page. You can use any search engine to get to it. But this book really is wonderful! It can really stand on it's own! I can't wait for more from this author. The publishing company needs to publish her stuff quicker than this! Can't wait till Darius's story, Dark Fire! Feel free for anyone to e-mail with any questions! I'll sell you on these books!   \n",

I have now read up to Black Dawn in the Night World series, and can't wait for more. I recomended these books to my other friends and they loved them too. I recomend ANY L. J. Smith books to anyone.   \n",

Cornwell sets up the perfect novel, albeit with a rather drab, reactive protagonist, but then suddenly swerves off the road and goes bonkers. For me the peak of the book was when Kay Scarpetta is threatened by the governor and is suspended from her job, but then Cornwell finds a way to tie this great, believable plot into, of all things, a Nazi war criminal, and that's where she totally lost me. Then there's absolutely no climax or showdown whatsoever. We just hear about the acts of the murderer second hand, and that was a big letdown, too   \n",

The scarletti curse is no different. Even though it is a definite change from the &quot;dark&quot; series, it still has her unusual but excellent writing style. I'm giving this book a four instead of a five because it started off a little slow in the beginning, but once it got going i couldnt put it down. It's a great start for a new series of christine feehan books.   \n",

It tells about how a little kid who lived in poverty with his mother goes on to become a six foot eight inch 245 pound high school basketball superstar. Lebron has to deal with the pressure of the media and go against tough opponents almost every game. Somehow he is able to handle all of this and all the other obstacles in his life. This is an entertaining book to read and I reccommend it to anyone who is a fan of Lebron James or is interested in reading about the rising star. The author does a great job of telling how Lebron is on and off the court. After reading this book you will come to respect Lebron as a basketbal player and a person.   \n",

I found it easy to read and remember the concepts, as they are presented in a straight-forward way, with an emphasis on real-world scenarios. The tips the author provides are valuable... I found myself using them a lot at work and on several projects. Because my previous HTML knowledge was so scattered, reading the book put my thoughts into place and provide a more formal picture of HTML and css. This book also addresses cascading style sheets and is loading with information. At this point I use it as a reference, the css appendix is comprehensive, tho I think the layout could have been done better-- some area are tough to read.   \n",

Karen Cummings writes a book that tells you all the basics in cat care and tailors it to the Birman breed. The excellent photographs enable the reader to see what a Birmans really looks like. The history of the Birman, (Sacred cat of Burma), it's mythic legend is beautifully illustrated in the artworks that appear on page three and on seven, &quot;Mandela Cat&quot; and &quot;Temple of the Sacred Cat&quot;. I am the artist of these artworks and I am very impressed with the excellent reproductions produced by the publisher. In addition, as a Birman, breeders for over 15 years I can and do highly recommend this book.   \n",
      "1   Dr Baker explains clearly and engagingly how one can improve one's life by changing your subconscious pattern through the spiritual technique called treatment. The essence of treatment is this: When the conscious mind of the individual deliberately selects a creative idea and delivers that idea to the subconscious, the subconscious mind acts as a law and proceeds to produce the equivalent of that idea in the individual's experience. The subconscious mind is the producer of one's experience, while the conscious mind is the decider of experience. Both phases of mind are spiritual processes working together - they are the God process in the individual. This wonderful work provides a spiritual technique for richer living. Chapters deal with, inter alia, Happiness, Wealth, Love, Success and Freedom, and includes helpful affirmations and prayers. On a par with the work of Joseph Murphy, Catherine ponder and Florence Scovel-Shinn, this book should be read repeatedly to provide the maximum ben   \n",

Very few fans of Feehan's Dark series seem to realize that although this book is not part of the Dark series, is the children and children's children of this couple will tie in to the Dark series later. Bryon's lifemate will come from this line. But if you want to learn about what's going to happen in the future books in this series as well as the Dark series, then go to Feehan's web page. You can use any search engine to get to it. But this book really is wonderful! It can really stand on it's own! I can't wait for more from this author. The publishing company needs to publish her stuff quicker than this! Can't wait till Darius's story, Dark Fire! Feel free for anyone to e-mail with any questions! I'll sell you on these books!  \n",

Cornwell sets up the perfect novel, albeit with her rather drab, reactive protagonist, but then suddenly swerves off the road and goes bonkers. For me the peak of the book was when Kay Scarpetta is threatened by the governor and is suspended from her job, but then Cornwell finds a way to tie this great, believable plot into, of all things, a Nazi war criminal, and that's where she totally lost me. Then there's absolutely no climax or showdown whatsoever. We just hear about the acts of the murderer second hand, and that was a big letdown, too  \n",

The scarletti curse is no different. Even though it is a definite change from the &quot;dark&quot; series, it still has her unusual but excellent writing style. I'm giving this book a four instead of a five because it started off a little slow in the beginning, but once it got going i couldnt put it down. It's a great start for a new series of christine feehan books.  \n",

It tells about how a little kid who lived in poverty with his mother goes on to become a six foot eight inch 245 pound high school basketball superstar. Lebron has to deal with the pressure of the media and go against tough opponents almost every game. Somehow he is able to handle all of this and all the other obstacles in his life. This is an entertaining book to read and I reccommend it to anyone who is a fan of Lebron James or is interested in reading about the rising star. The author does a great job of telling how Lebron is on and off the court. After reading this book you will come to respect Lebron as a basketbal player and a person.  \n",

I found it easy to read and remember the concepts, as they are presented in a straight-forward way, with an emphasis on real-world scenarios. The tips the author provides are valuable... I found myself using them a lot at work and on several projects. Because my previous HTML knowledge was so scattered, reading the book put my thoughts into place and provided a more formal and structured picture of HTML and css. This book also addresses cascading style sheets and is loaded with information. After reading the 1000+ pages, I use this book as a reference, the css appendix is comprehensive, tho I think the layout could have been done better-- some areas are tough to read.  \n",

      "1   Dr Baker was one of those great 20th century metaphysicians like Emmet Fox, Ernest Holmes &Thomas Troward, who understood the working of the mind long before psychotherapy became popular. This approach is called \"the religion of healthy mindedness\" by William James in his classicThe Varieties of Religious Experience.Barker explains clearly and engagingly how to improve one's life by changing your subconscious pattern through the spiritual technique called `treatment.' The essence of treatment is this: When the conscious mind of the individual deliberately selects a creative idea and delivers that idea to the subconscious, the subconscious mind acts as a law and proceeds to produce the equivalent of that idea in the individual's experience. The subconscious mind is the producer of one's experience, while the conscious mind is the decider of experience. Both phases of mind are spiritual processes working together - they are thedivine thought processin the individual.This wonderful guide   \n",

      "King James by Ryan Jones is a biography of Lebron's James' life prior to going into the NBA. It tells about how a little kid who lived in poverty with his mother goes on to become a six foot eight inch 245 pound high school basketball superstar. Lebron has to deal with the pressure of the media and go against tough opponents almost every game. Somehow he is able to handle all of this and all the other obstacles in his life. This is an entertaining book to read and I reccommend it to anyone who is a fan of Lebron James or is interested in reading about the rising star. The author does a great job of telling how Lebron is on and off the court. After reading this book you will come to respect Lebron as a basketbal player and a person.\n",

Very few fans of Feehan's Dark series seem to realize that although this book is not part of the Dark series, is the children and children's children of this couple will tie in to the Dark series later. Bryon's lifemate will come from this line. But if you want to learn about what's going to happen in the future books in this series as well as the Dark series, then go to Feehan's web page. You can use any search engine to get to it. But this book really is wonderful! It can really stand on it's own! I can't wait for more from this author. The publishing company needs to publish her stuff quicker than this! Can't wait till Darius's story, Dark Fire! Feel free for anyone to e-mail with any questions! I'll sell you on these books!\n",

      "The first 75% of this book is a 10. Cornwell sets up the perfect novel, albeit with her rather drab, reactive protagonist, but then suddenly swerves off the road and goes bonkers. For me the peak of the book was when Kay Scarpetta is threatened by the governor and is suspended from her job, but then Cornwell finds a way to tie this great, believable plot into, of all things, a Nazi war criminal, and that's where she totally lost me. Then there's absolutely no climax or showdown whatsoever. We just hear about the acts of the murderer second hand, and that was a big letdown, too\n",

      "Dr Baker explains clearly and engagingly how one can improve one's life by changing your subconscious pattern through the spiritual technique called treatment. The essence of treatment is this: When the conscious mind of the individual deliberately selects a creative idea and delivers that idea to the subconscious, the subconscious mind acts as a law and proceeds to produce the equivalent of that idea in the individual's experience. The subconscious mind is the producer of one's experience, while the conscious mind is the decider of experience. Both phases of mind are spiritual processes working together - they are the God process in the individual. This wonderful work provides a spiritual technique for richer living.

All the Non Ishida Sunday Telegraph books are printed in mass-market paperback form on cheap pulp paper (which easily rips if you use mechanical pencils like I do). The book is also very small (only 7 inches tall and 4 1/2 inches wide) and is bound like a regular paperback, so it's hard to keep open while you're trying to complete the puzzles. The other major problem with this series is that many of the puzzles are large, so that in order to fit them in the book, the publishers have broken up the grid to fit half on one page and half on the other! I get so frustrated, I want to cut the puzzles out the book and tape them to another sheet of paper before I do them.I'd suggest Mind-Sharpening Pixel Puzzles and Perplexing Pixel Puzzles, both by Peter Gordon, or Games Magazine Presents Paint by Numbers instead of these books, because of their large format and quality paper.   \n",

The plot is weak and pathetic, and the characters are too one-dimensional. Although it may pick up later, it certainly is not worth it.   \n",
      "625  &quot;The Story of a Man of Character&quot; as described by Thomas Hardy is somewhat flaccidly applied to this novel. In fact, a better description of this novel comes from a colleague of mine, Professor Neale Scott of the Baltimore University, who remarked &quot;I realise now I had mistaken the dullness of Henchard's character for the dullness of the whole novel.&quot;. Ultimately, Prof. Scott is quite accurate in his assessment of the text. The characters bumble around, waiting for circumstance to attach itself to their groins, and do very little of plausible importance at all. Henchard himself is, without doubt, one of the most irritating characters to be placed in 'classic' fiction, and one can't help but wish that the death of our tragic hero had happened an awful lot sooner, such as before the novel started. The character of Elizabeth-Jane, wonderfully parodied by Helli Kitchin, of the Moscow State University, is so blase towards her constantly changing parenthood that it completely ruins any sense of empathy that the audience may have for her. The least convincing Scotsman ever can also be found in this text, in the form of Donald Farfrae, and I am inclined to agree with Dr Daniel Greenfeld, whose thesis, &quot;Hardy makes the heart grow colder&quot;, points out that the author would not know a Scotsman if one jumped up and bit him, a way that most of us admittedly meet them. To sum up - I discourage my students from reading this shambolic text. Avoid this novel like the plague - it is so soggy, you couldn't even burn it to stay warm. Attempt, perhaps, to read something a little more plausible with something other that a praetorian wanderer and an intransigent hay-trusser to tantalise the imagination, something that the author was obviously lacking - Wessex indeed.   \n",

All the Non Ishida Sunday Telegraph books are printed in mass-market paperback form on cheap pulp paper (which easily rips if you use mechanical pencils like I do). The book is also very small (only 7 inches tall and 4 1/2 inches wide) and is bound like a regular paperback, so it's hard to keep open while you're trying to complete the puzzles. The other major problem with this series is that many of the puzzles are large, so that in order to fit them in the book, the publishers have broken up the grid to fit half on one page and half on the other! I get so frustrated, I want to cut the puzzles out the book and tape them to another sheet of paper before I do them.I'd suggest Mind-Sharpening Pixel Puzzles and Perplexing Pixel Puzzles, both by Peter Gordon, or Games Magazine Presents Paint by Numbers instead of these books, because of their large format and quality paper.  \n",

The plot is weak and pathetic, and the characters are too one-dimensional. Although it may pick up later, it certainly is not worth it.  \n",
      "625  &quot;The Story of a Man of Character&quot; as described by Thomas Hardy is somewhat flaccidly applied to this novel. In fact, a better description of this novel comes from a colleague of mine, Professor Neale Scott of the Baltimore University, who remarked &quot;I realise now I had mistaken the dullness of Henchard's character for the dullness of the whole novel.&quot;. Ultimately, Prof. Scott is quite accurate in his assessment of the text. The characters bumble around, waiting for circumstance to attach itself to their groins, and do very little of plausible importance at all. Henchard himself is, without doubt, one of the most irritating characters to be placed in 'classic' fiction, and one can't help but wish that the death of our tragic hero had happened an awful lot sooner, such as before the novel started. The character of Elizabeth-Jane, wonderfully parodied by Helli Kitchin, of the Moscow State University, is so blase towards her constantly changing parenthood that it completely ruins any sense of empathy that the audience may have for her. The least convincing Scotsman ever can also be found in this text, in the form of Donald Farfrae, and I am inclined to agree with Dr Daniel Greenfeld, whose thesis, &quot;Hardy makes the heart grow colder&quot;, points out that the author would not know a Scotsman if one jumped up and bit him, a way that most of us admittedly meet them. To sum up - I discourage my students from reading this shambolic text. Avoid this novel like the plague - it is so soggy, you couldn't even burn it to stay warm. Attempt, perhaps, to read something a little more plausible with something other that a praetorian wanderer and an intransigent hay-trusser to tantalise the imagination, something that the author was obviously lacking - Wessex indeed.  \n",

If you're looking for a challenge to read, you face two; deciphering the nealry 300 pages of rediculously long sentences, and staying awake. I even go so far as to say reading it is a complete waste of time, because the energy you must invest to understand this work' coupled witht the frustration of an endlessly boring stlye does not even compared to the information you will actually get out of it.\n",

No doubt about it: This book will provide the basic tools for keeping your boss happy, especially if you need a brush-up on moving averages, etc. Having vast experience with both advanced financial and non-financial analysis on various aspects of business (shipping and construction), this book was somewhat a let down in terms of ability to inspire and provide ways to improve personal skills to structure and present complex topics in an ordered and clear fashion. A nice bedtable-reader for the pre-MBA. MBAs should look elsewhere.\n",

      "I picked up this book looking for a solid and comprehensive overview of the historical context for current tensions between Israel and the Arab nations. In fact, the back cover has several quotes from reputable sources suggesting the value of this 'balanced' overview to diplomats, historians and students of the middle-east.It became clear,however, just two chapters in (covering pre-1945 history), that this wasn't an 'objective' account by an unbiased historian. In addition to the many citations to contemporaneous information sources (many from UN accounts), there are numerous general and unsubstantiated references throughout the book to the 'extensive zionist financial and political influence' supposedly contributing to the creation of the state of Israel. This premise draws heavily on the repeatedly discredited 19th century Russian publication entitled \"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\" which continues to be published today in dozens of languages throughout every region in the world. In addition, Zionist military actions are repeatedly characterized as \"terrorist\" activity while the opposing Arab and Palestinian military actions are downplayed and rarely characterized as anything unjustified.The book offers a very detailed view of the events related to the establishment of Israel, but is seriously flawed by its author's heavy anti-Israeli bias.For a very accurate and highly readable book on the subject, I recommend instead Myths and Facts: A Guide to the Arab-Israel Conflict (published by the Near East Report)\n",

      "Hardy paints a cruel picture of women in lower society. They are either tempted or cause evil mischief with a tragic ending. He had created a virtuous women in the form of Tess and ends her as a criminal. It is impossible for a women of Tess's virtue to turn into a criminal. I would not recommend this book to anyone who would look to escape from Depression.\n",

      "I will admit that I read this for an advanced high school English class last year, making me one of those notorious 'immature high school reviewers.' However, I'm an English major, and I try to give each book an equal chance and see how they fared in the end. Well, here is Tess:I'm a reader who minds terribly when realism is outweighed by drama and romance. It sounds terrible, I know, but I prefer realism, and become frustrated when there's too much drama and love in a book. 'Too much' is a matter of opinion, of course, but in my opinion, Tess contains too much. It begins to sound overly-Victorian. One bad, dramatic thing after another takes place, and each occurrence seems forced, as though Hardy pushed it onto the paper to further the development of another bad thing. You could say that this is called *plotting*, but it comes across to me as bad plotting.Remember, this is coming from a person who prefers Edith Wharton and John Dos Passos as their recreational reading. Drama and fiction are all okay in my book, but too much of anything is bad. Hardy needs more moderation, in my opinion. So to finish fairly, I'll say that Tess of the D'Urbervilles makes a great dramatic Victorian novel with a beautiful tragic message. However, readers like myself, who are frustrated by large amounts of romance,tragedy,and beauty, will agree that two stars is a perfect rating.\n",

      "Man Kzin Wars IX has four stories. The lead story by Poul Anderson is OLD, a repeat from another in the series. However, neither the Amazon entry nor the book itself make note of this; the publisher's dishonesty here is a real shame. The other three stories vary in quality, but at least two are good enough for this to be worthwhile in paperback next year.The one star rating reflects my poor opinion of repeated material with no warning. It probably would rate 3 stars otherwise. BTW, I am an old Niven fan, have read all his SF multiple times, and have read all of the Man-Kzin series.Amazon's automated machinery, or a hurried employee, has mixed in a bunch of reviews here that apply to other books in the series. It's too bad, but I've seem them mix up numbered series before. (See World Radio TV Handbook which is an annual series; they were selling the 2000 edition at a small discount to those who bought the 2002 edition!)\n",

      "Let's see. I read two other books just before I read this one. One was Haim Harari's book about terror and reason in the Middle East. Another was Brett Goldberg's about Jenin. And I also read some articles about the \"Columbia disaster.\" No, not the space shuttle, but Columbia University in New York City and its infamous Middle East Studies department. The author is a member of this department at Columbia. He's a signatory of the notorious divestment (from Israel) petition. He's a defender of fellow Middle East studies department member Joseph Massad, who calls Israel \"racist,\" and claims that Zionism is antisemitic! He's spoken out in favor of a Truth and Reconciliation tribunal in Israel to help achieve peace there (analagous to truth and reconciliation in South Africa). On this final point, I agree with Mamdani. We need exactly that. We need to put the Arab racists in front of the world community and get a big apology from them as well as a guarantee to stop their aggression and antizionist slanders. Unfortunately, Mamdani would turn this around, put the victims on trial and make them apologize to the thugs.In an age where a small but significant number of Muslims are terrorists and terrorist supporters, it becomes important to separate the sheep from the goats. Otherwise, all Muslims are going to be suspect. Mamdani is not helping matters by trying to justify terrorism.Mamdani talks about Jenin in this book. He quotes Ed Said, saying \"by what inhumane calculus did Israel's army\" besiege Jenin \"and call it a response to terrorist violence?\" And he continues by saying that \"we may never know the story of what happened in Jenin.\" Oh, but we know plenty of it from Brett Goldberg's book, and I think everyone ought to read it. Mamdani seems to want to pretend that book doesn't exist.As for suicide bombers, well, Mamdani wants to find a way to justify what they do. But why? What goes around comes around. Sooner or later, the shoe will be on the other foot, and people will use force against the thugs. Meanwhile, just what purpose does it serve to create a culture of death and destruction? Anyway, for reasons best known to Mamdani, we get stuff in this book such as:\"Suicide bombing needs to be understood as a feature of modern political violence rather than stigmatized as a mark of barbarism.\"And he goes on to imply that all this violence is simply noble self-defence. But it isn't. It is aggression. It is criminal.Haim Harari, in his book, was not kind to those who intentionally slander Israel. His recommendation is for people to stand up to the liars and say \"You are lying. You are deliberately spreading dangerous, vicious lies. Lies like these kill.\" Now, would it stop people from writing books like these if a few more of us were to say that? Probably not. But if enough of us said it often enough, universities such as Columbia would be forced to make a choice between scholarship and propaganda against human rights.\n",

      "Asimov is often said to have a flat style and to be unable to create credible characters. It's my opinion. And Asimov is never more ridiculous than when he writes about feelings, especially about love (scenes seem to be described by a child or a thinking machine). But this writer is still gifted at setting clever plots every reader will enjoy, for instance in his robots tales (of course do not expect more than a quality entertainment, as often with sci-fi). However, Fondation is not really a clever book ; it is not boring, but it has poor content. You will finish it but probably won't read it again. First problem, it is impossible to believe in psychohistory, which smells like positivist propaganda from the 19th century. And because he has nothing more than an adventure story to tell, Asimov uses all kinds of tricks to grip the reader, including lots of surprises justified by unlikely and twisted arguments, some of which you may find hard to swallow. To conclude, Fondation is a kind of cartoon : a succession of sketches, rather funny but unlikely. If you still absolutely want to read the book, don't read Dune before. As regards depth, writing, and imagination the two books are separated by lightyears.\n",

Being an avid fan of Asimov and the Foundation series,the younger version of the mathimatical genius did not match with older one who changed the history of his race for the better; nor did I think that the story with female very appealing, again it did not match. The story seemed tacked on to the series just to write another novel. It is unfortunate that the writer who invented the positronic brain,the three law of robotics, and of course the genuis of the foundation series wrote such a tacked on story.\n",

      "...To my surprise and disappointment, I found \"Foundation\" to be an exceptionally terrible \"book\", totally undeserving of the praise it has received here. As some of the other reviewers have pointed out, the writing style is of a very poor quality indeed. It is not only very dull and dry, but it is also totally lacking in any kind of style or art. The dialogue is simply dreadful, the character development is nonexistent, and the story is pointless and not at all well structured. The fact that this alleged \"novel\" is really a collection of short stories is readily apparent, as there is no cohesion and very poor correlation between sections. This is not memorable writing in any way and it has no redeeming qualities as a work of literature. In fact, the only time I should ever like to mention it again is as an example of poor writing, atrocious story-telling, and science-fiction that is totally wanting for any kind of inspiration. ...\n",

      "Recently finding myself with a lot of time on my hands after having just graduated school, I started picking up and reading a lot of the &quot;greatest&quot; works of science fiction. After having noticed all the editorials, reviews, and awards attributed to the Foundation series, I didn't hesitate to order all the books in the series. What a mistake! I'm not sure what people are seeing in these novels, but in no way do they even come close to approaching some of the other hallmarks of sci-fi, like Dune, Ender's Game, you name it. This book has a semi-interesting setup about trying to preserve civilization during a coming galactic dark age, but beyond that the book devolves into stupid scenario after scenario about how the Foundation is threatened but through the citizens' skill (i.e. sheer stupidity and dumb luck) they manage to somehow make it through the crisis only to face another yawner a few pages later. In between each crisis numerous years elapse, so by the time Asimov sets up the next unrelated crises, the entire cast of characters changes -- you barely have time to figure out their names much less get to know any person in significant detail.This series of books did nothing but put me to sleep on multiple occassions when normally if a book is good I'll stay up all night to finish it. My advice is to steer well clear from this series and try one of the other highly rated sci-fi books out there -- there are so many others that would be far preferable.\n",

      "I can understand why this book is considered one of the best science fiction books ever written, especially considering the time period it was written in. It has a very interesting concept of destination and cause and effect (although it is weak in execution and very weak in explanation). For these reasons and other I should only give this book a one star, but instead I gave it two and I will explain why later.There is almost zero character development in this book. The extremely short chapters jump thirty years to eighty years and more between chapters. Almost every &quot;book&quot; within this book has a new set of characters with only a few references of the &quot;heroes&quot; from the previous &quot;books.&quot; At times, this makes for very confusing reading because I had no idea who the new people were in the successive chapters.As mentioned in the title, this book suffers greatly from the Superman sydrome. By this I mean that you know the outcome before the events have unfolded. Superman can't be beat (except for by Doomsday in the comics but he comes back anyway) and therefor when watching the movies you know he wins. So there just has to be more elaborate plans and more complex ways of defeating him but he still will win. The same is true with the foundation. Harry Seldon, the prophet who esentially created the foundation, knew what was going to happen because he could see the future. Every &quot;book&quot; in &quot;Foundation&quot; will ultimately see the Foundation as the victor, so there just must be more complex problems arising, but of course the Foundation will ultimately prevail. And in this book, the problems are not really that complex, just different social economies arising to counter the previously established social economy that prevailed in the previous &quot;book.&quot; I can only imagine that in the later books the problems will get ridiculously complex - maybe even too complex for enjoyment.Because this book has almost zero characterization and is very predictable I would give this book one star, but instead I gave it two. The reason for this is because I have read the backs of the other books in the Foundation series and other reviews of them and I am interested in the storyline. I want to read about the Mule in Foundation and Empire, and I want to read about Earth in Foundations Edge. If not for that this book would recieve a one star rating from me and I would also never recommend this book or ever pick it up again.It may be a classic, but it's not that great. It's not great at all.\n",

Even though I got through it I cannot believe all of the outstanding reviews and awards this series has received. No characters, no science, no mystery (who couln't figure out the identitiy of the Mule?). In addition the story is basically one of the collapse of the Roman Empire. It probably could have been rewritten replacing historical language instead of spacefare and it would not have mattered in the slightest. The only science fictional element was Psychohistory which is not developed at all due to the nature of the plot. If this is a classic, I shall stick to more obscure and worthwhile reads. Blech.\n",

      "I just finished reading Foundation and was extremely disappointed. Maybe I was expecting too much, something grander along the line of the Dune series. But the book in of itself is an extreme disappointment. I realize Asimov was young (21) when he wrote this, but his style leaves a lot to be desired. I'll take an early Arthur C. Clarke book over Asimov anyday. This is the first book by Asimov I've read and I'm not sure I want to read another. His style is very dialoge driven with very few, if any, detail given to what the characters think. Everyone is very two-dimensional. And he never describes any of the scenes were all of this dialog takes place. Part of the interest in science-fiction is exploring new places, seeing different things. This entire story could have taken place on an empty stage. In fact, it seems like it's written more for a play than a novel. As for the story, it starts out interestingly enough. The Empire is going to crumble and to avoid thousands of years of dark-ages, a Foundation is set up to preserve the past learnings of the Empire. Well, that's what the original thought was at least. Soon we discover there's an alternate motive to this. Once we learn of this motive, the story goes straight downhill. Asimov skips decades from one page to another. Characters are introduced that we know pratically nothing about, and he never tells us anything about them. I've read history books that had more character development than he gives the people in this book. By the time I got to the end I found myself saying &quot;So what&quot;?

      "Disclaimer: I am judging this book as a standalone piece of work.Isaac Asimov's Foundation is the first of a series that would eventually be considered a cornerstone of the Sci-Fi genre. While it is certainly a solid piece of work, I don't quite understand how it is deserving of such praise. In my opinion, it suffers from an abundance of poor storytelling techniques, which reduce what is a great concept to a finished product that left me feeling empty. In fact, I struggled to finish the final pages, nearly racing through it solely for the sake of completion. I have rarely, rarely done this before. I'll start with the good aspects along with plot setup type-stuff first, and then finish with the overwhelmingly bad.The ideas and concepts behind Foundation are wonderful. The basis of the book is the work of Hari Seldon, the master practitioner of a discipline called psychohistory. If executed correctly, psychohistory has the ability to predict behavior of human beings thousands and thousands of years in advance through a combination of many disciplines, including mathematics, statistics, and psychology. It is, in essence, what modern day economics aspires to be. Being an economics major who currently works in the field, I found this to be highly compelling. In fact, it was from a blog post suggestion by Paul Krugman that I picked the book up in the first place.A bit more of the plot: Hari Seldon, the well-known psychohistorian, seeks to avoid an extended Dark Age, a period of 30,000 years in which barbarism runs rampant and tons of information is lost. His work in psychohistory leads to the establishment of the Foundation, which send ripples through the universe and ultimately attempts to shape its fate for the better. Hari Seldon is the first of a string of highly intelligent characters you'll meet, and Foundation is saturated with clever and thought-provoking dialogue amongst these characters. This, unfortunately, is where the good stuff ends.To say that this book is saturated with dialogue is a vast understatement. This book is 95% dialogue and it is the vehicle through which the story is told. This, I found to be abysmal. Even with an omniscient narration technique at hand, rare are the thoughts of characters, their descriptions, or an inkling of the settings on which these dialogues are taking place. One of the largest structural weakness of this storytelling style is that Asimov must infuse important details into his conversations. The problem with this is that these are details that would never come up in normal conversation. Thus, they come off as very awkward and ultimately serve to cheapen the dialogue. Not being able to get into the minds of characters leaves too much unsaid, which is the part of the cause of every section having the same structure: Person A is the plotter, Person B is the questioner. Person A knows something that Person B doesn't, Person B continually questions Person A about his plans, which all finally ends with a \"Don't you see?\" moment by Person A in which he explains his elaborately constructed conspiracy to Person B. This is the essence of every single section. By the time you get to the end, nothing is unexpected.And worse still, every single character is similar (except for one, who speaks with an accent and makes for a very comical section of the book). They are all intelligent, but not wholly different. Their lack of physical descriptions and thoughts serve to make them feel like the same lifeless replica of one another. The nature of the story, which causes there to be major gaps in time, make this even more egregious because just as you are getting used to one character, his section ends and a new character has replaced him. I felt zero emotion for these characters. As for the setting, this universe is not a living, breathing world. It is merely the outline of one, a skeleton of what could have been something magnificent. This bothers me. I am confident when I say that this book would have been absolutely stunning if Asimov had included 100 pages more of thoughts, descriptions, and settings.Some other small gripes: Asimov is prone to overusing adverbs, usually considered a literary sin. Foundation also has not aged well in terms of technology, as Asimov really misses on a lot of advancements that it seems other Sci-Fi authors were able to catch. I do not take any points off off this review for that, however, because the predictions he did make were far better than any I could have ever fathom, and I commend him in that regard. All I'm saying is that these misses, relative to other authors, aren't helping.\n",

      "After somehow assiduously avoiding Asimov's seminal \"masterpiece\" for over 50 years since I began reading sci-fi, I decided to dip into this ponderous tome.Oh, forsooth, the ancient bard's Shakespearean language came alive once more, only this time, more than 12,000 years into the future.But, lo, some things have never changed: women are little more than pawns to the men who run the Galaxy -- still concerned with \"housewife\" duties.Distance is still measured in miles; microfiche and paper still reign supreme; the priesthood flourishes; folks still haven't learned that smoking kills.Not one to espouse elucidation, the new bard Asimov floods pages with convoluted dialog that fails to eschew obfuscation.The five barely connected stories that comprise this mess are loosely thrown together in homage to Hari Seldon, as we are seldom harried by logic.While I realize that it's easy to criticize the grand master of sci-fi after his passing, someone must raise the cry that the emperor was born with no clothes.\n",

      "The book starts with an enticing psychohistory idea, but then it dives deep into politics. It is quite interesting to read the ingenious solutions for the crises taken by the great leaders of the Foundation, specially for resigning war whenever it seemed the most sensible way out.The problem is that this book is supposed to be science fiction, yet the story seemed to have happened back in the mercantilism period in the XVII century, with its priests, kings, viceroys and merchant ships trading raw materials for manufactured goods. The gadgets used by the traders to fool the other empires are a bit silly as well, for a far future based science fiction.\n",

      "When I was in junior high school, Asimov's Foundation Trilogy was my favorite science fiction. Recently, I picked it back up, and have had to revise my opinion somewhat.First, in terms of character and plot development, Asimov certainly hadn't hit his stride when he wrote these books. The characters are cardboard cutouts--especially the female characters.More importantly, Asimov uses the basic idea behind the series...that Hari Seldon created his &quot;psychohistory plan&quot; and launched it, invisibly determining the future of his Foundations for centuries...as a kind of magic box from which he pulls plot developments. This drains the story of dramatic tension. One knows from the get-go that it'll all work out in the wash. (In the second half of &quot;Foundation and Empire&quot; and &quot;Second Foundation&quot;, Asimov had found a way out of this problem, by introducing a wild card in the deck.)Finally, the book hasn't aged well. The technology forseen for his far-future galactic civilization seems positively &quot;retro&quot;. Normally, this wouldn't be a problem...Orwell's 1984 is still an effective piece of fiction, even though it's 2002, and the world is far different from the world Orwell envisioned...but the Foundation books' other flaws just seem to make this worse.\n",

      "The Foundation novel is very dated, which I suppose is a function of the time it was written. Women are almost entirely absent except when they turn to putty over pretty pieces of jewelry. A gun is an \"atomic blaster,\" and other quaint 50s relics.The one dimensionality of the characters is problematic. I have to admit that although I don't read a lot of science fiction, I know priority is never put on characterization. However, since nearly all of the ideas of the book are no longer relevant, this shortcoming becomes glaring. The book is more of a time capsule than a living book.There is actually a single main character who re-occurs as 3 different personas (Seldon, Hardin, and Mallow). SeldonHardenMallow is calm, calculating, and always right. His opponents flail around until the denouement when SeldumHardenMallow has maneuvered them into exactly the right position and emerges victorious. It's so predictable that there isn't any dramatic tension.The biggest problem I had with the book is that the politics seem very nave. This novel was supposedly based on Gibbon's \"The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,\" but Foundation seems to have only to most primitive understanding of that work.I don't really understand the love generated toward this book. It seems particularly flat. A lot of people seem to enjoy it -- just not me, I guess.\n",

This would be excusable if the protagonists were interesting.Go read Jack Vance or Gene Wolfe if you want masterful sci-fi!\n",

      "The book, Foundation, by Isaac Asimov, has promise but leaves the reader without satisfaction upon completion. Though having what initially appears to be a gripping plot, the grip loosens throughout the book. While philosophers may enjoy the lack of action and adventure, other readers who crave that amazingly described action sequence, will find that this is not the book to get. Taking place beyond the year 12,000 A.D, the Galactic Empire, spanning galaxies, is predicted by the revered physcohistorian, Hari Seldon, to crumble. On a mission to shorten a period of 30,000 years of barbarism after the fall of the Galactic Empire, to a mere millennium, he establishes an association, the Foundation, to preserve the Universe's knowledge in a giant Encyclopedia. Foundation takes place on many different planets in many galaxies across the universe. This book spans many generations and involves many characters, as the book covers in different plot lines that converge at the end.Foundation is a book that focuses on political issues, thus making the book void of action and adventure. This can make the book extremely boring and aggravating to some readers. The story focuses on conflicts among activist parties and groups conspiring against the political leaders of the Foundation's home world, Terminus, as well as diplomatic and religious conflicts between the Foundation's home planet, Terminus, and neighboring kingdoms such as Anacreon and Smyrno, along with greedy kingdoms bent on conquest of their neighbors. But out of the 285 pages of the book, there is only one significant action sequence, which is between the kingdom of Anacreon and the Foundation. The sequence involves a mass riot and uprising of priests on Anacreon's home world, along with the total emancipation of the Anacreonian naval fleet by a priest who threatens to curse the fleet. When characters, like the mayor of Terminus and his advisors, discuss war or the inevitability of a war, there never is an explanation of what occurs during the fighting, just a summary of the war, and who is the victor. An example is at the end of the book, when there is a war between the Foundation and the world of Korell, because of disagreements over religious beliefs and the tolerance of missionaries. The war is only summed up in an excerpt from the &quot;Encyclopedia Galactica&quot;. Another noticeable point about Foundation is how confusing it is in many aspects. The book is broken up into &quot;Parts&quot; that separate time, setting, and characters. A part entitled &quot;The Mayors,&quot; which takes place mainly on Terminus and involves the mayor, Salvor Hardin, and the relations between his world and the kingdom of Anacreon, is then followed by one entitled &quot;The Traders,&quot; which takes place many decades later and involves totally different characters in a different part of the galaxy. When and where each part takes place is not answered until later into the chapters of the part. Also confusing is the fact that new characters are introduced quickly in every part, thus making it harder for the reader to grasp. If the reader gets attached to a character or really likes where the plot and characters are going in a certain part, he or she will be unpleasantly surprised when those characters are never talked about again in the novel, after that part.One good thing about Foundation is that it expresses new and intriguing ideas about predicting the future through the science of psychohistory and what the human race and universe will be like in ten more millennia. This includes the idea of having a Galactic Empire that controls millions of planets. Along with ideas of nuclear power still being the most advanced power system, man-sized force fields able to block any nuclear handgun's blast and giant space ships with the capability to destroy planets are discussed. Also the ideas of monarchy being the prime governmental system is included in the novel. These may seem like interesting ideas that would make Foundation a great book, but the reader may find that these ideas also make the story harder to understand because they are either seemingly too primitive for the time period, or too far-fetched to be logical. This book could be someone's favorite book, if they happen to like philosophical books without action. It could also be the bore of a lifetime for some people.\n",

      "Foundation is the epitome of the ideal of the pessimistic technocratic utopian. Strange as it may sound, the plot is as follows: pseudo-science finds a way to predict future, politicians banish scientists, scientists establish new citizenry, trade flourishes, scientists gain control through pseudo-religion. This supposedly tried-and-true pseudo-science is a way to predict the future by way of studying human behavior (an oddly fatalistic view of a scientific universe). However, I disagree with the notion and invest my interest in the rival fund of the `Crazy Eddie' effect of Niven's Motie series where an individual can make the most drastic difference.I must further state that I was born in 1980 and began reading SF in 2007 with the likes of Niven, Bear and Brunner. I like my complex Iain Banks, voluminous Alastair Reynolds, mind-bending Greg Egan and ever-changing Brunner. Now while many of the so-called `old timers' have proclaimed Foundation sacred like the novels of Dune, I am of the new generation and of the new voice, which can't be held to the same standard as the last generation (or two). Times changes, ideals change, perspectives change, terminology changes, tolerable prefixes change and personal development changes. While Dune may have been impressive in style and scope, it did not satisfy me in content, interest and follow through. To these effects, I wish to express my dissatisfaction with Foundation.To paraphrase an excellent book about the relationship between psychology and musical composition entitled `Of Mind and Music,' the author states that repetition is an exploit of human emotion causing the listener (or in this case, the reader) to fall into a collective primal rhythm with fellow listeners (read: readers). Like in Foundation, the amount of repetition is akin to the acute attack of bass at a rave; theories are repeated endlessly, idiosyncratic allegories are scattered through every chapter and the word `atomic' was shotgun blasted, litter strewn, scattered to the winds, chucked without consciousness onto nearly ever page (sign of the times, I presume?). Here is the alphabetical list of `atomic' phrases found in Foundation:Atomic blaster, atomic drill, atomic drive (also the hyperatomic drive), atomic fire, atomic force, atomic force-shield, atomic gadgets, atomic generator, atomic knife, atomic power, atomic shear, atomic ships, atomic specialists, atomic techniques, atomic washing machine (bwah!) and atomic weapons.If `style' could mean the expressed use of repetition, the Asimov has easily seduced the science fiction reader of the early 1950s. With the blossoming (pessimists read: destructive radiation) of the atomic age, the dream of an atomic future must surely have seemed to be an optimistic fantasy. Nowadays, the equivalent would be novels which saturate their content with micro- and nano- prefixes. Thus, it seems as Asimov had the initial bug of beginning of the `atomic' prefix fixation? Did Asimov overdo it? In these regards, I stand to say that Asimov had a single-tracked mind.While reading the sciences and unfolding plot of the pseudo-science, I was constantly remained of the `Seldon crisis' and the mightier-than-thou proverb `Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent.' As an educated reader, I only need to be reminded once to have the full effect of conveyance and depth. Throw in the tame pre-sensor curses of `Oh, space!' and the cringe-worthy `Great galloping galaxies!' and you have for yourself a novel which is mildly aggravating, almost maddening. Repetition doesn't mean a solid follow through. Rather, it just means the author is either under-evaluating the reader of filling up word space.Additionally, the characters were as bland as cardboard for breakfast. Everyone seemed to be a utopian plutocrat or an idealistic capitalist in a struggling capitalist society. Scientists know best, so scientists so rule, right? It's ONE vision of style of government but the path Asimov takes is one of superiority and, ultimately, disagreement. The approach is too preachy to the benefits of an ideal technocratic civilization. Throughout, I understood the relationships and the dealings between opposing parties, but I found the unraveling as tedious as the usage of the word `atomic.' Politico scenes compounded by feudal titles bored me to bits, much like Herbert's Dune, Tepper's Grass and some of Wolfe's Long Sun series. While the over-all feudal scene works well with the future technocratic/religious society, I find the kowtowing to be overwhelming (more so considering I already live in a fairly visible feudal society).Inevitably, as the word and review suggest, I must say that the novel has failed to impress me in the year 2010 after 30 years of mortality and four years of reading science fiction. Surely, many modern novels must have been based off the ideals presented in Foundation, but from my standpoint in the ear 2010, I fail to see greatness which was intrinsically embossed upon it during its publication and further years of intense readership. In the year 2010, the novel does not stand the ultimate test of time.\n",

      "The book is written about an empire in the future. I'm not really sure why Asimov thought that the future galaxy would be ruled by an emporer, which is a dying system of government, instead of a democratic republic. I know this is nit-picking, but I didn't like this book.Apparently, the future can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy using math and statistics. Anyone who works as a mathematician or statistician, as I do, knows that it's difficult to predict what's going to happen in anyone's life tomorrow, much less the entire world 500 to 1000 years into the future using statistics.This book is intellectual worship, which is something I can't stand. Intellectual worship is when people think they are intellecually superior to everyone else, so feel they should rule over everyone else, if only you would listen to them. This idea drips off the page as event after event is predicted by some really smart dude. This smart dude predicted a collapse of civilization and treated it as inevitable. Another idea that's patently absurd- that any event that occurs is inevitable.If this guy was so smart as to predict, with a high degree of accuracy, the downfall of civilization, and the rising of a new one, along with the traumatic events this new civilization would go through, why wasn't he smart enough to avert the downfall of the original civilization. Surely, with his predictive ability people would listen to him, but he decides to let it crumble for whatever reason.And Asimov is a mediocre writer. The story is only moderately interesting because no character really gets developed. I read this book because as a sci-fi fan, I felt obligated.\n",

      "I enjoy Asmov's science books. They are informative, clever and witty. But his science fiction is another matter. They are poorly written. And worse, I didn't believe a word of Foundation. Such accutate prediction is impossible. It's not only extremely difficult to predict the major trends, but to have his character predict such minor details as well is absurd. Just one example of the difficulties of prediction: Isaac Asimov, a well informed and very intelligent man, missed the computer revolution, though it was already under way when he wrote Foundation.\n",

      "So many people like this book and have called it a \"classic\" - I felt I had to read it. I am not a hard-core sci-fi reader, but I did enjoy reading books by Herbert, Heinlein, Bradbury, and the like. So I though I'd give Asimov a chance. To my surprise, I didn't like this book at all.I have read some bad books in my life, but this is the first bad book I bothered to read all the way through. I kept waiting for it to get better. I kept waiting for the \"eureka\" moment when I finally understood why everyone likes this book so much. It never happened, and when I finally came to the end of the book, I realized that Mr. Azimov stole a good two hours of my life and gave me NOTHING in return.The story sounds interesting, and in the hands of another writer it may have bore fruit. Unfortunately, in Mr Asimoz's hands, the story falls flat in the implementation. Had the writing not been funny, I would have been completely bored. Of course, Mr. Azimov did not intentionally make me laugh - sadly, his understanding of the human condition appears to be based largely on old, cheap pulp fiction novels. The characters are completely one dimensional and unconvincing. I truly cannot understand why anyone would like this book - but calling it a classic is simply unbearable. I can only assume that most of the people reviewing this book favorably are children. In any case, they are certainly not familiar with truly good writing. My advice: avoid this book.\n",

I had always heard how great &quot;Foundation&quot; was, so I thought I'd start with this one. I was thoroughly disappointed! Asimov used way too many large words (&quot;using dollar words where dime words would suffice&quot;). The story seemed to jump around from one time to another. The characters were very one-dimensional and very flat...I didn't have that &quot;I wonder what's going to happen next to ---&quot;. I just didn't care what was going to happen next to the characters or in the story. There didn't seem to be anything to propel this story along; nothing to develop the characters or the story.

      "Right where a character talks about his old age of sixty-two years.Yeah, right. An advanced galactic civilization, thousands of years old, with FTL travel and turnkey exoplanets just right for human habitation everywhere, never bothered to find medical treatments for aging. That might have sounded plausible in science fiction 60+ years ago, but much less so today. The novel also suffers from a lot of faults which other reviewers have noted. Perhaps Asimov's stories blew geeks' minds in the 1940's and 1950's, but his work hasn't aged well.BTW, Asimov, Heinlein, Clarke, Carl Sagan and a lot of other scientifically knowledgeable people in the mid 20th Century accepted the existence of exoplanets based on NO evidence at all until the mid 1990's, while at the same time criticizing similar claims without evidence as woo-woo. Just by coincidence the exoplanet faith position happened to resemble observable reality somewhat - but it didn't have to. Even then, the existence of so many \"hot Jupiters\" surprised a lot of astronomers involved in the hunt for exoplanets. Exoplanetologists may not find plausible earthlike planets for many years.\n",

      "&quot;Foundation&quot; is considered by many SF devotees to be one of the greatest creations of the genre. It won the Hugo award to prove it, spawned many sequels, and even a couple of prequels. I was excited to read this book, expecting it to live up to its many accolades.Boy, was I disappointed!The basic idea of this novel is fascinating: Hari Seldon foresees the demise of the galactic empire using the science of psychohistory. He puts a plan into motion to lessen the catastrophic effect of this collapse. Will it work?This is a good concept to work from, and I liked the plot. It's classic SF.What I did not like was the writing.Asimov relies too heavily on dialogue. It reads like a play. The only narration present serves as &quot;stage direction&quot; to indicate that someone moves, or smokes, or exits, or whatever. I was not able to imagine most of what was going on, as Asimov never adequately sets the scene for us. People simply talk back and forth. Everyone talks excatly alike, and none of the dialogue sounds natural. With little attributions (he said, she said, etc.), it's often hard to tell just who is talking, anyway. It's an extremely frustrating experience as a reader.The other problem with &quot;Foundation&quot; (perhaps, its central problem) is that it tries to cover too much in too short a period of time. This is unfortunate, because, again, the premise is so good. A story like this must cover a great period of time to achieve its goals, of course. We have to find out if Hari Seldon was on the right track. Asimov introduces a host of charcters, but none of them stick around. Consequently, there's no one in the entire book that you know or care about. This is a major failing. A great SF novel cannot be just a clever idea. The great books of the genre have great characters who help us to understand and appreciate the clever idea. Look at &quot;Rendezvous with Rama&quot;, &quot;Ender's Game&quot;, &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;, &quot;Dune&quot;, or &quot;Brave New World&quot;. Each of these features great ideas and great characters.If this book were fleshed out a bit more with better descriptions and deeper characters who were actually given time to develop, I would like it much more. As it stands, it feels too thin -- it's the kernel of something really great.I recommend this only to die-hard SF fans who are getting back to the genre's roots, or those who value ideas over writing quality.I believe you must have both to be a true classic.\n",

I found the characters to be flat and one dimensional. The story uses unrealistic plot devices. Yes I understand that it's science fiction, but I find it strains credulity to think that the characters were able to invent a religion worlds-spanning religion in 30 years. It also didn't seem very likely that a 12,000-year-old empire would so quickly crumble into the stone age (I'm exaggerating slightly). I realize that this book was written in 1951 but the high tech stuff in the story was hardly high tech back then, much less in an empire spanned the galaxy.Bottom line: not an especially great read.\n",

Dull, mostly pointless conversations between people you don't know as the story jumps quickly over time ruin this book. And how lazy of Asimov to not develop his ideas. At one point he gets out of this by having a character watch a movie that we can't see which describes something that would have been interesting and clever had it been developed.I guess I'll finish the series because I've heard the other books are better.

      "With all the rave reviews about this book, perhaps I set my hopes too high. I just really didn't care for this book. There is almost no character development (since every chapter spans huge jumps in time) and the \"science\" in this novel takes a back seat to the political ideas of the author. With endless pages of dialog and few reasons to care about any of the characters, I had a very hard time getting through this one. And while I know it was written years ago, the author's science-fantasy was pretty much limited to \"nuclear powered devices.\" That just didn't feel like much of a stretch of the imagination, all things considered.I thoroughly enjoy sci-fi when told by authors such as H.G. Wells and Ray Bradbury. These authors know how to paint a picture in your mind and bathe your imagination in colorful imagery. In Foundation, however, I was thoroughly unimpressed by the style, context and story as told by Azimov - it was boring, unimaginative, and I never even had the pleasure of painting the scene being played out in my mind.

But then, the politics took over and the Sci-Fi aspect was completely lost. This book felt like a drama class play that could have taken place anywhere and almost at anytime. I never felt like I was in space or that anything related to Sci-Fi was present. I didnt mind the story so much but being a Sci-Fi book means that I expect some technical \"sciency\" details and didnt get anything in this book. I also did not like the huge jump from each major chapter regarding time. Just when you feel that the plot and characters are \"settlling-in\" you jump 80 years and have to start all over again. Lastly, there was very little scene setup. I rarely knew where the dialog was taking place or what the surroundings were...hence the comparison to a stage play.If you like Arthur Clark's style of Sci-Fi like me and prefer the Science aspect of Sci-Fi to be featured in books you read then I would not recommend this book.

      "I tried to listen to this story on CD, and aside from the story not being terribly interesting, I was surprised at Asimov's attitude towards religion. I suppose I shouldn't have been. He is a sci fi writer, after all. But I thought he was supposed to be a smart guy. He's not -- at least on this point.The basic outline of the story (at least the beginning -- I didn't make it all the way through) is that some guy predicts that the galactic empire is going to fall, so he tries to make provision to preserve technology so that the succeeding dark ages don't last as long as they otherwise might. Toward that end he gets a select group of scientists onto this relatively isolated planet where they can carry on their work, which becomes the invention and maintenance of a religion that's supposed to preserve certain technologies through the coming dark ages. In this religion the high priests understand the theory -- the technology and all that -- but the local priests and the people are duped into believing in some mumbo jumbo.It's as if you're supposed to picture some priest waving incense and saying prayers while he adjusts the knobs on the nuclear reactor, believing that it's God doing something while it's really just technology.I know that \"technology as magic\" and \"religion = magic\" are common themes in the sci-fi genre, but for some reason I expected better from Asimov. It shows a rather alarming lack of thought.Religious rituals are always geared towards the chaotic and the mysterious. There aren't religious rituals to cause the sun to rise, because it's regular and dependable, but there are religious rituals for storms and floods and harvests and childbirth and whatnot. Religion is also used to explain hidden things -- psychology, forgiveness, etc.IOW, religion is subject to criticism (\"it's not measurable\") in precisely the area where Asimov is trying to squeeze it. He's trying to make religion the mystical cloak for something that's regular, predictable and logical. It just doesn't work that way.If religious rituals had precise, measurable results, people would suspect that there's nothing religious or mysterious about them and they'd look for a material cause. Anyone who doubts that simply doesn't understand the religious mind, or hasn't been paying attention. Sure, there are gullible religious folk out there who'll believe anything, but the majority have half an eye out for tricks and deceptions.The very idea that you can hide technology behind a cloak of religious ritual is a rather silly science fiction writer's fantasy.Anyway, the story wasn't that compelling, and this \"religious cover for nuclear technology\" business was so incredibly stupid, I couldn't finish it.\n",

Foundation simply failed to ignite any spark in my imagination. The characters are poorly developed, largely because of the huge leaps in time throughout the book. In addition, the inability of a person writing sci-fi -- which by its nature looks to the future -- to envision any role for women in that future is deplorable. I thought Asimov's work trite, boring, and completely lacking in the sort of foresight that makes books by authors like William Gibson and Tad Williams so amazingly captivating.

Huneker's biography, besides being relatively short, takes off on gossipy tangents that often jump around in time making it hard to get a good feeling for Chopin's progression thru life.My problem with the musical descriptions (the book is divided into 76 pages of biography and 141 pages of music \"analysis\", divided into sections on preludes, mazurkas, etc.) is again the gossipy nature. For example, the chapter on the preludes is 13 pages long. The first four pages are strictly about who claimed when and where they were written.I recently played Prelude No. 4 in E Minor at Peabody in Baltimore. Prior to the recital, I was deluged with coaching at college master-class play-ins, etc. The discussions centered on things like why the downbeat beginning each measure is played weaker than usual, contributing to the feeling of hopelessness in the piece.Huneker's descriptions are: \"The melody seems literally to wail..\", \"This tiny prelude contains wonderful music\", \"The whole is like some canvas by Rembrant..\"In the relatively few times Huneker does go into musical detail there may be some insight, but just as frequently a few bars of music are shown accompanied by an explanation like, \"Volcanic mutterings these!\" -when the music shown is a pianissimo (played very softly) passage!For anyone looking for insights on actually playing the pieces, Walker's \"The Chopin Companion..\" which can be found \"used\" at Amazon, is a much better choice.\n",

      "Orwell is one of the most overrated novelists of this century. He's nothing more nor less than a second-rate hack who profiteered by preying on the worst fears of modern man. Today, his book is the modern bible of the paranoid disgruntled white male and other conspiracy nutcases. Yet another fairy tale, albeit a grown-up one, warns us to LOOK OUT for that proverbial boogy man--Big Brother, in this case, being the latest in a long line of aliases he goes under. Perhaps Orwell's &quot;Newspeak&quot; should include these additions: &quot;Propaganda is Truth&quot;; &quot;Truth is Absolute&quot;; &quot;Freedom springs from Fear&quot;; &quot;Extremism is Virtue.&quot; This book has never made anyone stop to think, but, instead, to fear and hate one more faceless abstraction. Contemporary paranoia gets a much more powerful portrayal in the works of Thomas Pynchon, such as &quot;The Crying of Lot 49.&quot; At least IT has the virtue of being well written.\n",

      "1984 is a very creative and well written book, Winston Smith the main character who is an insignifacant member of the ruling party in London in the nation of Oceania. Everywhere he goes he is video taped by cameras of the so called &quot;Big Brother&quot; party. This books talks about Winston on how he thinks what the &quot;Big Brother&quot; does is unfair. I enjoyed reading this book, it was very creative and well written. It makes me appreciate what I have in life. I also woundn't like the situation that Winston is put by being watch all the time. I reccommend this book to people who are willing to sit threw some boring parts and who love science fiction.

      "This summer we read this book. I hated this book for several reasons. First of all, the story was way too jumpy. It started slow, and then randomly got fast. It had absolutly no suspense to it. I found myself forcing myself to read! I couldn't relate to any of the characters! For instance, some of the characters were too boring. Maybe if I read this book in this book in ten years I would have a different opinion. Another reason why I didn't like this book, is because the characters weren't seen enough. They were all just thrown in at different times. You didn't feel like you got to know them very well and I hate that. I would not recommend this book. I think that Ray Bradbury needs to rethink his book ideas! I do not want to be critical of Ray Bradbury, but really I couldn't stand this book. It had no meaning to me. It also, had a poor plot and setting. For instance, it was plotted in the future yet it was no different than today. I don't plan on reading anymore or Ray Bradbury's books!\n",

      "The story of Fahrenheit 451 is a complicated one that tries to explain the future in an odd way that is not often expressed. It brings you into the warped mind of a fireman, who burns books rather than puts fires out. This book proves to be very novel and is interesting at times, but at other points it just seems boring and outright ridiculous. When I read this novel it made me think of what the present day government might do behind our backs to censor certain materials, but the novel can be so confusing that it is hard to find the relationship. Despite these setbacks, it shows how a few wrong moves and decisions by humans today can end up in grave results in the future.In this story, the main character Montag begins to run into people that alter his mind and make him think about the ethics of his job, which of course is burning books. Montag used to live his life smelling of kerosene, ravaging people's houses, and setting books aflame, but he wants to know why he is doing these deeds in the first place. It is sort of difficult to see how books could be so horrible that they should be banned and burned. You learn later in the story, if you can read inbetween the lines of difficult language, that the government has put a ban on all books to prevent them from corrupting the minds of the people living at the time. Montag learns this and begins to live two lives; one as a fireman, and the other as a madman hiding books in the vents of his house. While this is happening a war is going on that is so hard to understand and so irrelevant that it should just be ignored. The book continues to become more confusing, and the end is just unimaginable and pointless.If you love books that are outdated and totally science fiction, then this is the novel for you. It is a great piece of work that was new and exciting when it was written, but to most people today it would just seem odd and nauseating at times. It is totally unbelievable, and it was difficult for me to sit down and read this story because it was so complex and involved. It takes a person with an extremely vivid imagination to read this novel. It was meant to show how people can not let the government get out of control because they will eventually corrupt and control the minds of every last person on the planet, but this point is lost somewhere amongst the many plots and twists. It tends to be very odd take on the subject, and I would not really recommend using your time to check it out.\n",

In one hundred years, will both islands be populated assuming that reproductive technologies are not available to either group? I suggest that Planet Alpha will be; but Planet Beta will not. Why?

      "As I opened this book, I thought to myself &quot;Wow! This seems like a great story!&quot; I found myself growing more depressed and disgusted with every page. Although the style and Marquez' technique are unquestionably wonderful, the overlaying themes of lust, lack of self-control, and immorality outweighed the good. The goal of nearly very character's life is the same; to please him or herself. Very few characters are in the least bit caring of self-sacrificing. The only way I could reconcile myself to reading this disapointing work was the fact that it is a lesson in man's depravity. I realized that every person, without God's intervention, is just as bad or worse than Marquez' perverse characters. The book is not without its high points- I loved the ending, the mystery of the Segundo twins, and Ursula's strength. There are some passages where the language is incredible. Marquez is a mastery of imagery! I only wish that there had been more positive images to remember....\n",

      "This book has a different approach of studying for the GRE Chemistry exam. Instead of spoonfeeding you all the correct answers to the questions, it gives you all the wrong information so that you will be forced to think if every single item is correct or not. Since Chemistry is a very strict subject, meaning, if one atom or bond is misplaced, everything becomes invalid, reading the book becomes a tedious experience rather than an enriching experience. It is very sad that the Princeton publishers did not even bother to proofread the book, and if they ever even bother, it is most likely for grammatical purposes rather than for the Chemistry content. I have written to the Princeton publishers reagarding this issue and all they can say is they are very sorry that I am disappointed. Do you think that is enough compensation to the disappointment I have regarding this book? I have heard that they are planning to release a new edition.

I say this because of the following1- It's a small book on a big language which means brief explanations and very few examples.2- Even with this size, the author has wasted quite a lot of book space to show his sense of humor (which I didn't find very humorous, sorry Peter).3- The book is not very well organized.4- The author claims that you don't need to know C++ to learn Java from this book. I find this claim a bit ambitious. Specially when author himself refers to different aspects of C++ to clarify certain concepts.In short, if you want to read some jokes, learn how to make a paper airplane which can carry payload (I'm not kidding), know authors views about how software are and should be named, read some inside information on Sun Systems, enjoy digs at Microsoft and learn Java, buy the book now.

      "&quot;The Story of a Man of Character&quot; as described by Thomas Hardy is somewhat flaccidly applied to this novel. In fact, a better description of this novel comes from a colleague of mine, Professor Neale Scott of the Baltimore University, who remarked &quot;I realise now I had mistaken the dullness of Henchard's character for the dullness of the whole novel.&quot;. Ultimately, Prof. Scott is quite accurate in his assessment of the text. The characters bumble around, waiting for circumstance to attach itself to their groins, and do very little of plausible importance at all. Henchard himself is, without doubt, one of the most irritating characters to be placed in 'classic' fiction, and one can't help but wish that the death of our tragic hero had happened an awful lot sooner, such as before the novel started. The character of Elizabeth-Jane, wonderfully parodied by Helli Kitchin, of the Moscow State University, is so blase towards her constantly changing parenthood that it completely ruins any sense of empathy that the audience may have for her. The least convincing Scotsman ever can also be found in this text, in the form of Donald Farfrae, and I am inclined to agree with Dr Daniel Greenfeld, whose thesis, &quot;Hardy makes the heart grow colder&quot;, points out that the author would not know a Scotsman if one jumped up and bit him, a way that most of us admittedly meet them. To sum up - I discourage my students from reading this shambolic text. Avoid this novel like the plague - it is so soggy, you couldn't even burn it to stay warm. Attempt, perhaps, to read something a little more plausible with something other that a praetorian wanderer and an intransigent hay-trusser to tantalise the imagination, something that the author was obviously lacking - Wessex indeed.\n",

A collection of short takes on individual lives that started out in WWII and went well from there, one can sit and read until drowned in sugar. The message is clear: this is the generation that fought the war, came home heroes, set up shop and became successful at everything. Available in large print and on cassette, it is targeted for the generation that, having putatively done it all, now want to sit and admire themselves.I would like to offer a modest corrective: this is the generation that brought us fallout shelters, fast food, theme parks, the Vietnam war--just a little one for the kids?--and the edsel. Furthermore, as the saying goes, they don't get it: They don't get it about ecology; they don't get it about population control; they don't get it about gays in the military; they don't get it about the importance of innercity kids, they don't get bluejeans, t-shirts, or the Rolling Stones. I am glad these people had good lives, of course, but I came a little later (1945) and I live in a different world from them.

      "Mostly rubbish - as a book and especially as a Feinstein book.John Feinstein broke new ground with &quot;A Season On The Brink&quot; and successfully used the same formula with &quot;The Majors&quot; and &quot;A Good Walk Spoiled&quot; (although the former was a better book).&quot;The Open&quot; is confirmation that Feinstein has completely adopted a paint-by-numbers approach. A typical paragraph/chapter follows:...John Doe was a skilled high school/college golfer, eventually lowering his handicap to 3. He thought about joining the minitours or becoming a club/range pro but was offered a job with &lt;insert corporation&gt; out of the blue. Through mutual contacts, he met &lt;insert USGA staffer&gt; and acted as a &lt;insert golf tournament job&gt; at a local qualifier. He eventually worked his way up the USGA ladder and is now responsible for &lt;insert title or duties&gt; at the US Open and other national USGA events...There are two big problems with this approach:1) Feinstein tries his hardest to portray each person as unique, but this Mad Libs style of writing gets repetitive when applied to dozens of individuals.2) It's a transparent attempt to humanize some of the stuffed shirts at the USGA. Unfortunately, some of them are beyond rehabilitation. Tom Meeks, in particular, comes off as even more arrogant and pigheaded (which is quite an accomplishment, in a way).I don't know if it's an East Coast/Long Island/political thing, but there are far too many groups who demand some form of tribute before they will cooperate. Feinstein attempts to portray the local governments, police, and transportation officials as helpful but watchful; instead, they come off looking like the tinhorns they are. The Masters, the Memorial, any number of tournaments are carried off year after year with similar crowds and logistical problems, but those events are not treated like a moon shot. Our own wonderful Department of Energy (of the people, by the people, for the people...or something) causes problems by refusing to allow vans transporting the players to the 10th tee to drive on their precious service road. In short, the tournament was carried off in spite of all the 'help' the USGA received, not because of it.I'm sure Feinstein stayed up late trying to think of a way to inject his buddies on tour, particularly Paul Goydos, into the storyline. As luck would have it, Goydos had the very first tee time of the Open, so we are treated to more incredibly boring coverage of this journeyman. This 'everyman' approach worked well in Feinstein's first golf book, but three volumes later it has been worn threadbare.As others have stated, if you're looking for coverage/insight into the top names in golf, read the newspaper or GolfWorld. If you are dying to find out how Suzy Smith sets up her armada of cash registers in the merchandise tent, pick up a copy of &quot;The Open.&quot;\n",

So isn't nice to read a classic novel with straight-forward writing that aims for no insight into society or people? Actually no, it's kind of depressing. The Mayor of Casterbridge relies on coincidence, melodrama, and, as the afterword in my edition puts it, &quot;the constant exploitation of chance happenings to determine situation and hence the fate of his characters.&quot; I chose this Hardy novel because it was supposed to be character-centered. The story starts with Michael Henchard selling his wife and child at a fair. I thought this book would examine his redemption, it would be a Lord Jim type tale of profound psychological insight. A strange event like that is a good way to get a book started, but the crazy, unlikely events just keep a-coming. You feel nothing for the characters, ever.

      "\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\" ought to be the model of what a classic is not. Books deemed as a \"classic\" are said to be everlasting and universal in its message. This book does not spread its wings into our era, and it does not apply to everyone in some way, unless you've experienced paternity uncertainty and emotional neglect. The characters are rigid, changing without reason, and lacking practical emotions. Michael Henchard is repulsive from the start, from when he sells his wife and child, to his emotional withdrawal towards the young woman who turned out to be his non-biological daughter, to hiding the truth of who her father actually was to Elizabeth-Jane, so one cannot pity his outcome. Elizabeth-Jane, the non-biological daughter of Henchard, was completely void of personality. \"Blas&eacute;\" has more personality than Elizabeth-Jane. After a tennis match type life, of being flung back and forth between fathers, to marrying Donald Farfrae who one day courted her, married another woman (who just happened to be the landlord of the house Elizabeth-Jane was living at, at the time), and then realized his affection for her, Elizabeth-Jane would've been a prime candidate for therapy (how could she give her heart to men who kept being introduced as her father?), but instead acted as if she was a spokesperson normalcy. Finally, Donald Farfrae, a Scotsman, who was the poster boy for blandness, never really showed growth. He was always monotone, and I could not tell if he found Elizabeth-Jane's biological father to scorn Henchard, or truly help Elizabeth-Jane find the truth.

      "&quot;The Story of a Man of Character&quot; as described by Thomas Hardy is somewhat flaccidly applied to this novel. In fact, a better description of this novel comes from a colleague of mine, Professor Neale Scott of the Baltimore University, who remarked &quot;I realise now I had mistaken the dullness of Henchard's character for the dullness of the whole novel.&quot;. Ultimately, Prof. Scott is quite accurate in his assessment of the text. The characters bumble around, waiting for circumstance to attach itself to their groins, and do very little of plausible importance at all. Henchard himself is, without doubt, one of the most irritating characters to be placed in 'classic' fiction, and one can't help but wish that the death of our tragic hero had happened an awful lot sooner, such as before the novel started. The character of Elizabeth-Jane, wonderfully parodied by Helli Kitchin, of the Moscow State University, is so blase towards her constantly changing parenthood that it completely ruins any sense of empathy that the audience may have for her. The least convincing Scotsman ever can also be found in this text, in the form of Donald Farfrae, and I am inclined to agree with Dr Daniel Greenfeld, whose thesis, &quot;Hardy makes the heart grow colder&quot;, points out that the author would not know a Scotsman if one jumped up and bit him, a way that most of us admittedly meet them. To sum up - I discourage my students from reading this shambolic text. Avoid this novel like the plague - it is so soggy, you couldn't even burn it to stay warm. Attempt, perhaps, to read something a little more plausible with something other that a praetorian wanderer and an intransigent hay-trusser to tantalise the imagination, something that the author was obviously lacking - Wessex indeed.\n",

      "This book is similar to a Dickens novel in that it seeks not to reach perfection, but to please its audience at the time. Like Dickens, it is very dry and filled with hard to believe coincidences that make the story hard to swallow. Still, Hardy paints a very lively, realistic and flowing impression of the English countryside in the early days, before the industrial revolution. I would recommend this only if you are obsessed with Hardy, if you have run out of books to read (try Fifth Business by Robertson Davies) or if you are forced to read this as a part of some course.\n",

      "I have an early edition of this book, published in 1968.The author believed that the end times were imminent, and that was (at the time of this writing) 42 years ago.Most of the \"signs\" of the then-imminent apocalypse are basically that the world of the late 1960's was filled with sin and decadence. To believe that the late 1960's were the most sinful times in world history requires tremendous ignorance of the inhumanities committed through prior centuries.The funniest of the author's \"signs\" of an imminent apocalypse is standup comic Buddy Hackett giving a performance filled with ranchy humor and foul language. Am I supposed to believe that God is more worked up over a raunchy standup comedy performance than He had been over the various wars, genocides and famines through the previous centuries?In my opinion, an educated, objective reader could never take this book seriously, but may enjoy it for some laughs. (On a similar level, you can enjoy watching bad science fiction films like \"Plan 9 From Outer Space\" just for laughs.)Side note: this book is just one of HUNDREDS of failed predictions of the end of the world through the centuries.

Tess has absolutely no backbone. She pines away for stupid Angel who is more cruel to her than the guy who raped her in many ways. I know women weren't as strong at that time but even so, she is still pathetic. When she tells Angel that she would jump in the river and kill herself for him, I laughed out loud! Tess is a spineless, pathetic excuse for a human being. She needs to take some lessons from Jane Eyre, a hundred times better heroine. Also, Hardy describes the same stupid valley so many times that the book drags on forever and seems like it is never going to end.

      "Having read a number of classics recently, I have come to the conclusion that many of them are \"classics\" because they are great books to study, not great books to read. I'm sure I could spend years dissecting this book and finding new allusions, hidden references, and coincidental parallels. In fact, I found myself forced to re-read and, in some cases, grammatically deconstruct such large portions of this book to \"get\" it that I could probably claim to have read the book twice with a pretty straight face.If the book had been just a little worse, I would have been spared a lot of effort because I could have just written it off as being bad. Unfortunately, every time I was ready to throw in the towel, Thomas Hardy would throw in a turn of phrase or new way of seeing something that made me decide to ride along just a little longer to see where this was headed.In the end though, I have to cast my vote with many of the low star reviews here. Thomas Hardy's characterization of the landscape, farms, and villages beats his character development hands down. The plot moves like a fault line (millimeters per year followed by sudden jumps) and, frankly, by the end I felt more sense of elation at having reached the last page than a sense of regret that \"the President of Immortals had ended his sport with Tess.\" For once, I'm guessing that the Cliff's notes would be a better read than the actual book.\n",

Tess is a weakling who acts illogically, vacillates and secures the reader's complete disgust before the end. One should already know it from the title and the first few pages, where Tess's father, a peasant, finds out that he is the relic of an old noble family (his real name is Durbeyfield). Why cannot books have sense? All through the novel I longed to be reading Pride and Prejudice or Middlemarch. The time this book was written in has nothing to do with it; both the two books just mentioned were written considerably before it.

However, overall, it is an interesting story at least and I enjoyed the book. But considering the ending seemed to be rather ill-fitting to the rest of the tale, I'll have to pass on giving it a high rating. It was rather disappointing to slog through his odd phrasings and quirks, only to be let down at the end by the characters just magically changing personality traits.

      "Tess of the d'Urbervilles is a novel remarkable only in its quality to inspire hatred from those unfortunates forced to read it. Melodramatic and unrealistic, it meanders interminably exploring the theme of a &quot;pure woman&quot; before finally finishing with an ending that has little impact on the disgusted reader.Tess is, in short, a useless book. Apart from keeping a healthy fire roaring in my hearth, Tess contains little of merit. Well, I suppose one could improve one's vocabulary by reading Tess (fun, but completely useless words like &quot;prestidigitation&quot; abound), but reading &quot;How to improve your verbal scores on the SAT&quot; is inarguably more concise and probably more entertaining.Not to say that there is nothing to be learned from the characters. Simply observe their actions in certain situations and do the opposite. The three main characters, particularly Tess, are just begging to have a little common sense smacked into them. However, Tess can be considered enigmatic in one respect. Hardy seems to be unable to decide whether she is just ordinarily pretty, or 'a dazzling fair milkmaid' so it is up to the reader, should he still be awake, to decide. At any rate, her big, multi-colored eyes and Pre-Raphaelite hair and figure hide a complete vapidity painfully evident to the modern reader. She only develops a spine near the end of the novel, when such a change is unconvincing and thoroughly out of character.So...a predictable and heavily padded plot, infuriating characters, too much symbolism, inappropriate philosophical discussions and a great dollop of Victorian fluff. The result? Tess of the d'Urbervilles roasting on an open fire.\n",

      "When is pain the necessary entry price for involving oneself in great fiction, and when is it simply something you might call \"author abuse\"? I believe the tipping place can be found somewhere in the pages of Thomas Hardy's most famous novel.In it, we meet young Tess Durbeyfield, a simple English farm girl who struggles to make it through everyday life. Her father, convinced he's the rightful heir of an extinct family of Norman nobles, the D'Urbervilles, is a shiftless layabout who drinks and lets his numerous children do his chores. The family starves quite pitifully until fate puts in the first of several appearances. Tess meets a rich young bravo who goes by the D'Urberville name and decides to merge his bloodline with that of Tess, no matter what she thinks about that.Alec D'Urberville is one of two men whose attentions cause Tess much heartache and make up the substance of the book. Actually, there are three such men if you count Hardy, which I pretty much do. Alec is a right cad and Angel Clare, the other man, manages the impressive feat of being much worse, but neither lays for Tess the snares Hardy does, of horrible coincidences, contrived reverses in character, and way too much tolerance for ill treatment. There's even a letter-swallowing carpet. Man, I hate when carpets do that!When Hardy isn't pounding poor Tess into the ground, he's doing the same to us, pointing out how Tess in her misery represents the nullity of our common existence. \"She might have seen that what had bowed her head so profoundly - the thought of the world's concern at her situation - was founded on an illusion,\" he writes. \"She was not an existence, an experience, a passion, a structure of sensations, to anyone but herself.\"If only!Here's the rub. \"Tess\" is a pretty pleasing book to read if you manage to ignore or at least discount the plot. Hardy writes with great verve and knowledge about the world of his characters, fictional Wessex with its villages of hayricks and barn dances. At times it's like reading Wordsworth, and at others it's like reading Lovecraft. I don't know how else to describe a writer who can wax so lyrical and then shift into something darkly surreal and macabre without missing a beat. He was a master of description at the height of his powers in 1891 when he published this.\"Tess\" is also a deep book, with much Biblical allusion and symbolic foreshadowing matted into the subtext. Reading the novel with an online study guide helps bring out a rich harvest of Hardy's learned genius, as you can see the careful layering and connecting up he does throughout the book.Alas, it doesn't make the story itself any more digestible.Tess herself is hard not to care for, but she's frustratingly passive in a way that can not be blamed simply on the time and place where her story is set. She seems more of a piece with something Hardy was trying to say of the human condition, of suffering being one's lot in this vale of tears. You keep hoping things will turn around, but pretty soon you see the author has other ideas. Hardy pretty much wants her to suffer, so she does.Maybe in some imaginary alternative existence, I'll be treated to the scene of Hardy being called to some kind of literary court of law, answering for the misery he put me through here. I'll gladly waive my charges against him - only if they let me watch when it's Tess's turn to collect.\n",

      "The whole tragedy is in the fact that I was NOT forced to read this book but actually picked it up because I WANTED to read it (or so I thought at the time). I have read many books in my life, quite a lot of them classics, but I have to say that this book just about drove me bananas. I think there is a general misapprehension in thinking that a classic must be good.I dare not even think of how many times I probably came close to being committed to an asylum for acting suspiciously on the train while reading \"Tess\" (every two seconds I would sigh, roll my eyes, scoff or just plain throw my hands in the air from frustration). Many reviewers had rightly pointed out that the character of Tess is the shubbiest excuse of a woman in the whole Solar System. How can anybody, in any age, on any continent, be as spineless and masochistic as she is? This woman is more of a martyr that Joan of Arc, for crying out loud.The excuse that this book takes place in Victorian England doesn't quite cut it. I saw more strength and backbone in Hester of The Scarlet Letter (which story took place in a much more prudish and puritanical setting than England of 1800's).I think Thomas Hardy invented himself a woman who would act like his cocker spaniel; no matter how much he beat the crap out of that 'faithfull friend' the poor dog would always come crawling back and lick his boots, which is pretty much how Tess acts throughout the book. The whole scenario smacks a lot of a perverted male fantasy. Maybe Hardy had a nasty mother, who knows. I bet psychiatrists would have a field day with the author.I am disappointed and feel cheated of the time that I could have used to read something else; Dickens, for example. Or just Maeve Binchy, if I wanted female driven narrative. \"Tess of the D'Urbervilles\" would have been a much better book if that idiot-of-a-husband and Tess herself would fall into that bloody river in the middle of the book (exactly as Tess wanted it) and have done with it. I know I would applaud such a great ending!In short: steer way clear of this one.\n",

      "Having a degree in English Lit., it seems sinful for me to accuse Thomas Hardy of being a terrible writer, but there it is. Any writer today submitting a manuscript like this would have it rejected out of hand. This is not a book for an audience seeking a good, fast-paced story that speaks for itself. If you read this book, you will have to interpret every word, description, and action, try to guess what universal message the author is attempting to convey and what the characters are thinking and feeling at any given time. In short, the kind of book that college English professors love, and try to emulate, and remain college English professors because they will never get such a thing published.First of all, character development is not only lacking, it is absent altogether. It might be assumed that the book's title character, at least, would be strongly drawn, someone we could sympathize with, empathize with, or relate to in some way. Not the case. While Hardy expounds upon Tess' physical appearance ad nauseum throughout, never did I gain any real insight into her thoughts and feelings, her motivation. Maybe the insight is hidden in these endless physical descriptions or her inane actions, but frankly, if I'm reading for pleasure I don't want to take the time to search. Sorry. And it follows that if Hardy failed in his title character, forget about all the others.Secondly, his wordiness is irritating. One paragraph of half-way interesting action is followed by a full page of useless description and genuflecting. Perhaps essential to hidden meanings and motives and social commentary, but again, I'm not taking the time to search. I found myself skipping over these, the result being my finishing the book in two evenings.Conversely, Hardy seems to gloss over the most important event in the book, cloaking it in overly subtle tones. Granted, this was written during the sexually-repressed Victorian Era, for an audience with \"delicate sensibilites\", but come on. Something as traumatic and life-shattering as rape, in fact the event that is supposed to drive the entire novel, deserves more than an allusion to medieval knights taking advantage of peasant girls. Not that I want graphic details, on the contrary. But please, give me a break; even if her society deems she take it as a matter of course, let us see, clearly, her inward rage, hurt, bafflement at what has happened to her. Something. Anything. Make her human, in other words.If you really must read this, a synopsis would be enough. The novel's idea is a good one, and could have probably been done brilliantly by someone else. Hardy fails it miserably.\n",

      "A great windbag of a novel, Hardy seems to think that not only does a grassy meadow take half a chapter to describe, he thinks that everyone else agrees with him. Please. Not the largest complaint I have, but surely the first, is that Hardy's style is like looking up looking up &quot;stone pillar&quot; in a thesaurus, then two others, and then writing down every single synonym. It takes pages for him to describe a dairy farm, and at some point you wonder if he's introducing the farm as a character, it gets so much time.Not that he seems to spend that much time on his characters; they are created with little that interests, and contain less development that a homeless shelter under President Bush.Tess is described, at great length, and quite often, as a beautiful woman. Okay, so what? Her personality is so weak I wonder if he even thought about what she would do in a situation, or just had her do whatever the other characters wanted her to do, until the very end, when she makes an out of character action that is supposed to be shocking, but is more perplexing; the character described in the rest of the book wouldn't do that, and there is nothing to indicate why she has a sudden change of being.Angel is built up as the &quot;perfect prince in shining armor&quot; until he finds out about Tess's secret, when he suddenly acts like a selfish and snotty child that is the very opposite of what he has been in the rest of the book. Then he switches back at the end, with little thought as to why by Hardy, at least not much that is apparent in the book.Let's see, boring writing style and poorly done characters, what else is there? Ah, plot. The only way to describe plot is that it made the description seem riveting and his characters thought out. He's spend the time to talk about Tess getting a job, then the next chapter she is suddenly running away from it; I felt robbed of the time spent in the build up, and knowing more in detail of what happened in the intervening time from when she got the job to when she quit would have helped with her character. And when you think there is no need for detail, Hardy's got more than enough. He spends ages talking about Tess and Angel's time together at the dairy farm, but none of their actions change the way they feel about each other. He could have cut our some of their horse riding, and no one would complain.In short, Hardy's the kind of writer who is analogous to a storyteller that likes the sound of his voice; just because he can say something, he does. And in his endless drivel, what might be interesting is skipper over. This guy could have used and editor.When it first came out, this book was ill received, and I see no reason for anything to have changed since.\n",

But his plot (to be frank) stinks.The moment the reader meets Tess Durbeyfield he or she knows exactly what her fate will be. The book is a ridiculous web of intertwined coincidences which finally succeed not in giving the novel the air of a distinguished and accomplished work, but of a silly contrived plot line filled with poorly developed characters that could easily be crammed into 20 short pages. And the book might be all the better for it.The point is that after I read this book and labored through the hundreds of pages and looked up archaic English phrases and fluffy words that Hardy seemed to fill the pages with, I was struck at how much time I had wasted to learn so little, how disappointing it was to be forced to read so much obsequious symbolism and heinous happenstances.Don't read this book unless you have to.

However, I'm an English major, and I try to give each book an equal chance and see how they fared in the end. Well, here is Tess:I'm a reader who minds terribly when realism is outweighed by drama and romance. It sounds terrible, I know, but I prefer realism, and become frustrated when there's too much drama and love in a book. 'Too much' is a matter of opinion, of course, but in my opinion, Tess contains too much. It begins to sound overly-Victorian. One bad, dramatic thing after another takes place, and each occurrence seems forced, as though Hardy pushed it onto the paper to further the development of another bad thing. You could say that this is called *plotting*, but it comes across to me as bad plotting.Remember, this is coming from a person who prefers Edith Wharton and John Dos Passos as their recreational reading. Drama and fiction are all okay in my book, but too much of anything is bad. Hardy needs more moderation, in my opinion. So to finish fairly, I'll say that Tess of the D'Urbervilles makes a great dramatic Victorian novel with a beautiful tragic message. However, readers like myself, who are frustrated by large amounts of romance,tragedy,and beauty, will agree that two stars is a perfect rating.\n",

      "This book, while perhaps well written, is just so ridiculous and self-contradictory that it's maddening to read. While it's necessary to forgive him some annoying parts of his style as being a part of his age, one cannot overlook the horrible plot and characterization.Not one of the characters in the entire book is coherent or believable. He begins with a stereotype--the innocent country lass (Tess), the skeptical intellectual (Angel), the depraved rich dandy (Alec)--describing mainly their appearance and superficial thoughts, so that they never rise above the stereotype. Then, if they stereotype doesn't suit the plot, he'll simply have them act in complete contradiction of their previous shoddy characterization, without any explanation of how they might have changed. Angel's rejection of Tess, for example--he, the skeptical nonconformist who questions conventional social mores, suddenly repudiates Tess for being the victim of a rape, despite his own questionable conduct. I might expect that behavior from a conceited hypocrite, but not the all-around good guy that Hardy has made Angel out to be. And it's not like we've made a discovery here about Angel's real nature, because Hardy goes right on describing him the way he had before. Of course, he takes her back, which is perhaps believable, except that he has not a moment of hesitation when he finds out she murdered Alec. So when your wife tells you she was raped, you leave her, but when she kills someone, you help her to escape without even a second thought?Then there's Tess. She seems like a pretty resourceful and sensible girl right up to the point where Angel leaves her for a stupid reason and she spends the next five years or whatever pining for him. She writes him one scolding letter, and then regrets it. And even though she can't muster the courage to approach Angel's father, or tell Angel off, or rebuff the advance of Alec--although Hardy describes her as having \"natural fearlessness\" at one point--she can somehow stab Alec later.Alec, of course, is the one who first becomes a preacher because someone talks to him on the road, and then gives it up because Tess is just too darn beautiful. You'd think some more convincing would be needed for either conversion, but nope, Hardy can't spare any time for actual character development when he could describe Talbothays again.Finally, I can take an example from a minor character. At one point in the book Hardy describes Izz Huett, a milkmaid, as \"by nature the sauciest and most caustic\" of the milkmaids; a mere 20 pages later he describes her as \"a girl of tact.\" Did he read what he wrote before sending it to the publisher?Aside from the contradictions in every one of his major characters (and a lot of the minor ones too), there are also points in the book that are just plain ridiculous. I mean, Stonehenge? Come on. How cheesy can you get? Not to mention the fact that he sent sixteen cops after them so they could be surrounded in the morning. It's as if he put stuff into his book because he thought it would be cool. Same deal with Angel going to BRAZIL. Also, apparently Angel can pick berries with his whip. Hardy also tends to get carried away with his own writing. He once mentions the plains of Brazil (if by \"plains\" he meant \"rain forest\") and describes a cow's \"large-veined udders.\"Lastly, the book oozes prejudices about country folk and women--mostly to the effect that they're naive and ignorant. In fact, Hardy seems to share the prejudices of Angel Clare. In any case, this book is a lot of reading in return for all the reward of a trashy romance novel.\n",

      "I'm a French student of English, in my third year at university. I have to read \"Tess of the D'Urbervilles\" for my British literature class and it's just terrible. The author spends so much time describing Tess' beauty, virtue, kindness and courage, that I wonder why her name is not Mary Sue. There is no character development : instead, we are told a hundred times that Tess' eye colour is somewhere between blue, violet, grey and black -- seriously, can you picture that ?Furthermore, the heroine's so-called \"kindness\" is nothing but stupid weakness in my opinion. Her love interest, Angel Clare -- who, for some obscure reason, is also loved by most of her dairymaid friends --, blames and rejects her for being raped, and yet she still worships him and behaves like his obedient slave, despite his cruelty to her. This is merely a ridiculous and unhealthy obsession, not a true love story.To my mind, the only likeable character is Alec D'Urberville. Although he is supposed to be the \"villain\", I find him rather funny and much less annoying than Tess and Angel. Too bad that Thomas Hardy did not choose Alec as the main character.

      "&quot;The Story of a Man of Character&quot; as described by Thomas Hardy is somewhat flaccidly applied to this novel. In fact, a better description of this novel comes from a colleague of mine, Professor Neale Scott of the Baltimore University, who remarked &quot;I realise now I had mistaken the dullness of Henchard's character for the dullness of the whole novel.&quot;. Ultimately, Prof. Scott is quite accurate in his assessment of the text. The characters bumble around, waiting for circumstance to attach itself to their groins, and do very little of plausible importance at all. Henchard himself is, without doubt, one of the most irritating characters to be placed in 'classic' fiction, and one can't help but wish that the death of our tragic hero had happened an awful lot sooner, such as before the novel started. The character of Elizabeth-Jane, wonderfully parodied by Helli Kitchin, of the Moscow State University, is so blase towards her constantly changing parenthood that it completely ruins any sense of empathy that the audience may have for her. The least convincing Scotsman ever can also be found in this text, in the form of Donald Farfrae, and I am inclined to agree with Dr Daniel Greenfeld, whose thesis, &quot;Hardy makes the heart grow colder&quot;, points out that the author would not know a Scotsman if one jumped up and bit him, a way that most of us admittedly meet them. To sum up - I discourage my students from reading this shambolic text. Avoid this novel like the plague - it is so soggy, you couldn't even burn it to stay warm. Attempt, perhaps, to read something a little more plausible with something other that a praetorian wanderer and an intransigent hay-trusser to tantalise the imagination, something that the author was obviously lacking - Wessex indeed.\n",

      "I read this book for my English exam and after reading it, I cannot understand how it can be described as a classic novel. The only possible reason that I can come up with is that people in 19th century England, did not have things like T.V. and so were absolutely desperate for anything to entertain themselves. This is possibly the most boring book that I have ever read. Nothing happens! I feel that a lot of people call this book a classic simply because some literary expert happened to like it once, and so these people, in a vain attempt to appear more intelligent than they are, simply churn out someone else's opinion, without actually thinking of their own response to the novel. I don't know how many copies of this book have been printed, but it is bound to be a large number, and all I can say is that it is a huge waste of paper which could have been put to better use elsewhere.

      "Modern novels can be so pretentious, with their needless philosophizing and conscious experimentation with the language. So isn't nice to read a classic novel with straight-forward writing that aims for no insight into society or people? Actually no, it's kind of depressing. The Mayor of Casterbridge relies on coincidence, melodrama, and, as the afterword in my edition puts it, &quot;the constant exploitation of chance happenings to determine situation and hence the fate of his characters.&quot; I chose this Hardy novel because it was supposed to be character-centered. The story starts with Michael Henchard selling his wife and child at a fair. I thought this book would examine his redemption, it would be a Lord Jim type tale of profound psychological insight. A strange event like that is a good way to get a book started, but the crazy, unlikely events just keep a-coming. You feel nothing for the characters, ever. You learn nothing in the end, except life is cruel and if something can go wrong, it will. Read something else.\n",

      "&quot;The Story of a Man of Character&quot; as described by Thomas Hardy is somewhat flaccidly applied to this novel. In fact, a better description of this novel comes from a colleague of mine, Professor Neale Scott of the Baltimore University, who remarked &quot;I realise now I had mistaken the dullness of Henchard's character for the dullness of the whole novel.&quot;. Ultimately, Prof. Scott is quite accurate in his assessment of the text. The characters bumble around, waiting for circumstance to attach itself to their groins, and do very little of plausible importance at all. Henchard himself is, without doubt, one of the most irritating characters to be placed in 'classic' fiction, and one can't help but wish that the death of our tragic hero had happened an awful lot sooner, such as before the novel started. The character of Elizabeth-Jane, wonderfully parodied by Helli Kitchin, of the Moscow State University, is so blase towards her constantly changing parenthood that it completely ruins any sense of empathy that the audience may have for her. The least convincing Scotsman ever can also be found in this text, in the form of Donald Farfrae, and I am inclined to agree with Dr Daniel Greenfeld, whose thesis, &quot;Hardy makes the heart grow colder&quot;, points out that the author would not know a Scotsman if one jumped up and bit him, a way that most of us admittedly meet them. To sum up - I discourage my students from reading this shambolic text. Avoid this novel like the plague - it is so soggy, you couldn't even burn it to stay warm. Attempt, perhaps, to read something a little more plausible with something other that a praetorian wanderer and an intransigent hay-trusser to tantalise the imagination, something that the author was obviously lacking - Wessex indeed.\n",

      "\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\" ought to be the model of what a classic is not. Books deemed as a \"classic\" are said to be everlasting and universal in its message. This book does not spread its wings into our era, and it does not apply to everyone in some way, unless you've experienced paternity uncertainty and emotional neglect. The characters are rigid, changing without reason, and lacking practical emotions. Michael Henchard is repulsive from the start, from when he sells his wife and child, to his emotional withdrawal towards the young woman who turned out to be his non-biological daughter, to hiding the truth of who her father actually was to Elizabeth-Jane, so one cannot pity his outcome. Elizabeth-Jane, the non-biological daughter of Henchard, was completely void of personality. \"Blas&eacute;\" has more personality than Elizabeth-Jane. After a tennis match type life, of being flung back and forth between fathers, to marrying Donald Farfrae who one day courted her, married another woman (who just happened to be the landlord of the house Elizabeth-Jane was living at, at the time), and then realized his affection for her, Elizabeth-Jane would've been a prime candidate for therapy (how could she give her heart to men who kept being introduced as her father?), but instead acted as if she was a spokesperson normalcy. Finally, Donald Farfrae, a Scotsman, who was the poster boy for blandness, never really showed growth. He was always monotone, and I could not tell if he found Elizabeth-Jane's biological father to scorn Henchard, or truly help Elizabeth-Jane find the truth. I felt naught for the characters but purposelessness, and the story itself was uncreative and improbable. I do no recommend.\n",

The author advocates &quot;free range&quot; and &quot;more natural&quot; animal products in place of tested, safe chicken and dairy products. As a veterinarian and graduate of The Ohio State University College of Food, Agriculture, and Environmental Sciences, I can testify that the quality of such &quot;natural&quot; products is often much lower than their farm-grown counterparts. Furthermore, the agricultural processes decried by this author in fact serve to make our food supply safer than ever before. Certainly this book does not present an &quot;expert&quot; opinion, nor does it provide safe and accurate information for the women who need it most. As far as the rest of the information in this book, I found it outdated and, in other cases, inaccurate.

      "The title of this monograph well describes its subject: the lives of women during the Renaissance. However, Margaret L. King pays close attention to the roles available to women in the family, church, and high society. This text's intended audience is the general academic community. This book's purpose is to clarify the nature of women's lives during Renaissance.King's primary thesis is that women did not have a Renaissance. The realms of family, church, and high culture all relegated Renaissance women to subservience in some way. In the family, women were essentially their husband or father's property. In most cases, the church viewed women in a similar fashion. Conversely, in high culture, Renaissance women had a chance of wielding power and receiving education. King relies on diaries, religious texts, trial transcripts, medical literature, and several personal letters to support this argument.This book examines the Renaissance, defined by the author as the period from 1350 to 1650. Subjects discussed include the cultural, economic, and political circumstances of women. The first chapter is titled \"Daughters of Eve: Women in the Family.\" Here, King asserts that Eve's punishment in Genesis epitomizes the lives of Renaissance women. According to this story, the punishment for Eve's sin is that all women have to endure labor pain and remain subservient to men. Similarly, a Renaissance woman's worth is dependent on her ability to produce several children in succession and remain submissive to her male family members. King goes on to discuss a woman's progression from daughter, to wife, and eventually to a widow. She ends this chapter by discussing the woman as a worker. Here, King's main argument is that women's public labor was mostly menial and became increasingly restricted as time went on.In chapter two, \"Daughters of Mary: Women and the Church,\" King examines Renaissance women's role in the church. Unlike women in the family, the lives of women in the church do not revolve around bearing children. However, women of this realm still remain nominally subservient to men. In discussing women and the church, King starts by examining women who live in convents and those who live in autonomous and uncloistered female religious communities. King also spends a moderate amount of time discussing women and the reformation. She argues that while Catholicism provided an alternative to family life in the form of a convent, Protestantism provides no such choice. King ends the chapter by discussing witch-hunts, which she likens to genocide.In chapter three, \"Virgo Et Virago: Women and High Culture,\" King examines the role of Renaissance women in the upper class. These women enjoyed better access to education and some attended school. King also mentions a few rare Renaissance examples of female rulers. All of these educated and powerful women upset the gender roles for women in Renaissance society. Some of the words used to describe these women include Amazon, armed maiden, and crone. At the end of this chapter, King examines primary sources created by Christine de Pizan, Modesta de Pozzo, and Mary Astell. Using these sources, King finishes her book by examining the way women's ideas about themselves changed during the Renaissance. Specifically, they began seeing themselves as equal to men.This book does carry out its purpose of clarifying women's lives during the Renaissance. Some of the strengths of this book include extensive use of primary evidence and the author's knowledge of the existing literature on this subject. It also has an extensive bibliography and index. Nonetheless, this text has significant faults. The most significant fault is the complete lack of a proper conclusion. King's entire summary consists of two paragraphs on the last two pages of the third chapter. King also continually jumps from one side of Europe to the other. Occasionally, she even discusses women in America. This disorients the reader and inhibits the academic usefulness of this text. Due to these shortcomings, the reviewer is hesitant to suggest this book as a good resource.\n",

Who can not help laughing at sentences like &quot;Chopin distrusted Jews, but that's the way Poles are.&quot; The French, English, Germans, and Hungarians: Huneker comes up with some interesting stereotypes for them too. Many of the facts are incorrect, as the editor supplies the corrected facts in the footnotes on nearly every page of the text. And the music discussions have the spirit of &quot;What a powerful melody! However, I believe the third note of the 14th measure of Etude 12 op. 10 should be an F sharp, though it's written differently in some scores.&quot; What a snore.

      "The biography is very disappointing, the musical descriptions are poetic but don't get into much detail. If you want a general feel for Chopin's music but don't want intricate musical detail, the descriptions of the pieces may suit your need. That's the only reason I didn't give this book the lowest possible rating.For biographical info, \"Chopin in Paris\" by Tad Szulc is much more informative and accurate. Huneker's biography, besides being relatively short, takes off on gossipy tangents that often jump around in time making it hard to get a good feeling for Chopin's progression thru life.My problem with the musical descriptions (the book is divided into 76 pages of biography and 141 pages of music \"analysis\", divided into sections on preludes, mazurkas, etc.) is again the gossipy nature. For example, the chapter on the preludes is 13 pages long. The first four pages are strictly about who claimed when and where they were written.I recently played Prelude No. 4 in E Minor at Peabody in Baltimore. Prior to the recital, I was deluged with coaching at college master-class play-ins, etc. The discussions centered on things like why the downbeat beginning each measure is played weaker than usual, contributing to the feeling of hopelessness in the piece.Huneker's descriptions are: \"The melody seems literally to wail..\", \"This tiny prelude contains wonderful music\", \"The whole is like some canvas by Rembrant..\"In the relatively few times Huneker does go into musical detail there may be some insight, but just as frequently a few bars of music are shown accompanied by an explanation like, \"Volcanic mutterings these!\" -when the music shown is a pianissimo (played very softly) passage!For anyone looking for insights on actually playing the pieces, Walker's \"The Chopin Companion..\" which can be found \"used\" at Amazon, is a much better choice.\n",

      "It is a wonderful book to read about a virtual reality. It is also very good written not like Hawking`s History of Time. On the other hand, it is more about mathematics than about physics.I believe that one can create as Leibnitz philosopher once said as many mathematical theories as you can which will be consistent and elegant but eventually have nothing to do with reallity. Kaku and other &quot;leading physicists&quot; working in other dimensions are so blind with their own ideas that do not even admit the possibility that their &quot;scientific work&quot; is only isotheric game. It is most likely lead to nothing but he is pushing to follow his (very possibly wrong treck), descarding other important alternatives. What about his words that the modern string theory is more the faith than science? I agree because its verification is so far from allmodern experimental facilities. It is a curious mathematical game but nothing else.If Kaku and other &quot;leading field physicists&quot; knew that there several recent indications about incompleteness and inconsistency of classical Maxwell's electromagnetic theory than they would have a bit doubt on the completeness and overall correctness of Einsteins's relativity based exlusively on Maxwell's electrodynamics.First of all, physics should have very sound consistent fundamental ground and after that go further. It is not the case. In a recent few years many honest physicists started thinking about reconstruction of Maxwell's electrodynamics. It just lead to the conclussion that there is something wrong with the notion of local field. It should be modified on its bases. Someone who does not believe that we can be on partially wrong track since Maxwell, can follow Kaku's and other string physicists and eventually lost their life for nothing...\n",

Nothing else.If someone have had some the smallest indication that there is at least one extra dimension, I would look at these virtual ideas as at something more sound. Meanwhile we should develop a more realistic approach affin with everyday reality. Unfortunately, some of advanced modern theories predict the possibility of extradimensions. It is worse for that theories and, of course, it makes us think that something might be wrong with the previous theories (Maxwell's, Einstein's etc). I do not say everything should wrong because of visible success of that theories in explaining most known phenomena. But we do not know if the explanation is the best one or if something lacks. Without that knowledge we should not develop so abstract mathematical theories, because the may have nothing common with the reality. Extra dimensions looks like a typical example of this absurd extrapolation of not fully confirmed modern theories.It is better forget about Kaku and his extravagant ideas and come back to the REAL WORLD. It would be much more fruitful for our Civilization.\n",

      "I found this book as disappointing as The Prayer of Jabez book. I also felt I was re-reading sections from her husband's book in her book; his words were just changed around a bit. There was nothing new nor were any original ideas presented in the book.She makes reference on why God loves to answer such a prayer as the Jabez prayer. Does that mean that God does not answer other kinds of prayers, and only chooses \"prayers such as . . .?\" I think not. She talks of women being very fearful and giving up on miracles in their lives. Well, thoughts have energy and if one constantly thinks fearful thoughts, then fear shows up in our lives. If one does not believe in miracles happening, then they won't. Ernest Holmes, in his ministry, stated, \"Change your thoughts, change your life.\" Jesus was able to do what he did, not only because of his faith, but also because of the power of his thoughts. Faith is a huge concept.The feeling I get after reading this book is that if one says this prayer then the miracles unfold. If one doesn't believe, or is skeptical, or has negative thoughts, their lives will not change. The author also talks about supporting one's husband. How about the husband supporting his wife's career? It works both ways and spousal support is not just \"one\" way. Have I stepped back into the 50's here? Satan is also mentioned in her book, which, in my review of the Prayer of Jabez, is getting old. We have free will, which God has given us. Our choices need to be held accountable by the person who made them and not blamed on someone else.She also makes reference that we have to realize that Jesus died for payment our sins and once we accept that we are saved. I think not. God's Spirit is with us always and if one does or does not accept the above statement, it does not mean that God will not bless us. We are God's expression on earth. We are already whole and complete and we are loved always. I am really tired of reading \"Christian\" books where the guilt it constantly laid on. This book also does not talk about a forgiving and loving God, which is very disappointing.She also talks ad nauseum on fear, on women's fears. Sure we all have fears, but again we either give into them or change them. It makes me wonder that as a minister's wife, she is so filled with fear, where is her supportative husband? Does she feel that insecure? Has her husband not helped to boost her self-confidence or has she been put down and made to feel insecure.

      "I heard the author on NPR and rushed out and bought the book. I was very disappointed. I think this book is full of esoteric insights about history and culture, and tries to tie things together that are just not there. For instance, just to give one example, the author talks about the oil/automobile complex that dictates U.S. policy. So what ? That is true in every country (Japan, Germany, France, etc.). Everyone has to drive to work, and thus, oil and cars are important. So what ? It is a banal insight, masquerading as profundity. The author then evern tries to tie this back to whale fishing in the 1700s, etc. I just didn't buy any of this.Also, if there is a \"car complex\", then I would think it would affect the Democrats much more than the Republicans, the Democrats being centered in the northern auto-producing states like Michigan. Do you really think that Clinton was not influenced by the auto industry (SUVs and large trucks were introduced during the Clinton administration, not after Sep.11, as the author states, and the author provides a list of psychological reasons [\"security\"], why people wanted those large vehicles [the real reason is, Americans haul things like boats]. All this happend under a Democractic administration, not under the Bushes. The Democrats are much more likely to be \"in bed\" with the auto industry than the Bush family is.Regarding religion, yes, the evangelicals are sometimes very weird [I personally don't want someone to have nuclear weapons, who believes that the 'End Times' are here, and the anti-Christ exists as a real person !]. Yes, they are powerful in terms of sheer numbers [100 million !], but as David Frum [ex-White House aid] said, in his time in the White House, one single large union in the U.S. put vastly more pressure on the White House in terms of wanting concrete legislation to be passed, than the entire \"religious right\", which mostly, in his view [he is a Jewish Canadian] want to \"be left alone\". What have the evangelicals actually accomplished at the national level in terms of real legislation and laws ? Have they overturned Roe vs. Wade ? I read the other day that Walmart is being forced to carry a contraceptive, even though it goes against the religious view of the company leaders and most of the customers. Is that the \"religious right taking over\" ? Name one \"victory\" that the evangelicals have achieved that really is significant (they can't get a stone tablet with the 10 Commandments put on state grounds, they can't get small stickers put on books stating the \"evolution is a theory\". At the 2004 GOP Convention, the evangelicals were not even allowed to speak, and were treated like \"odd relatives\", and pushed into the background, which to me shows that the GOP knows it can't win with them on a national level. [it should also be noted that Clinton spoke a lot more in his speeches about God and religion. In addition, Democrats like House speaker Nancy Pelosi can say things like \"to us Democrats, the environment is a religious issue\", and that is viewed as ok, but god-forbid if a Republican should mention religion and politics !!].And whenever business interests collide with \"social conservative\" agendas, the business side ALWAYS wins (for example, Bush signing into law a new bankruptcy bill, which helped the financial industry, but hurt families). So this idea that the evangelicals are gaining the upper hand is not true. At the state level, I would say it is true (I live in Texas, and the Religious Right has basically taken over the GOP here, going so far as to insert all kinds of odd things into the party platform like, the U.S. should leave the U.N, which does in a way conform with Phillips' assertion that the \"wackos\" [which is a term a Republican lobbiest famously used to describe them] are taking over, in the south, at the state level]. But not at the national level. Re the financial aspects of the book, also true, but you can say that about Clinton or any president. Do you really think Clinton was not influenced by the \"credit industry\" (wasn't Bob Rubin, a cabinet member under Clinton, directly from that industry, for example] ?This idea that the U.S. is just another \"great power\" in decline, and that what we see today are just signs of that (\"religious extremism\") to me is just \"too easy\" to really be true, and has already been said before in the book, \"The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers\"; but that book I think was mostly discredited. One reason for \"religious extremism\" is just that in the U.S., we allow more freedoms than in other countries [which control the churches directly], and one reason why so many Ameircans are in debt is because we are a rich people and we are free and we like to buy things. We use a lot of oil because our country is very big, and the oil industry is very efficient. The strengths of our country are in software, finance, and entertainment, not in oil or cars. So, all in all, the book didn't do much for me.The author states the old economic theory that if you make things, you are rich, but if you do finance (\"move money around\"), you are poor. Well, not true. Mexico makes a lot of things and has a strong manufacturing base, whereas Singapore and Switzerland are services and finance-based economies. And yet, those economies that \"push money around\" are vastly better off than Mexico, where people drive down to the factory to \"make things\". Japan also makes things, and has been in a 15-year macroeconomic decline.If you are liberal Bush-hater, you will see all your beliefs reconfirmed. But I doubt this book will convince the rest of us.\n",

So I took it upon myself to objectively read the book to see for myself what all the controversy was all about.When I read Boettner's book (Yes I did read the entire book, all 466 pages of it) I found so many flaws, made up dates, councils that did NOT take place, and unsubstantiated claims just in the first few chapters, that I HAD to completely finish the book just to see for myself how much of a bigoted author this Loraine Boettner is, and WHY he would write such a book.In the end Boettner never tells the reader WHY he wrote this book, but if I were a Psychologist of a Psychiatrist I would come to the conclusion that here is a man (Boettner) who is extremely jealous of the Roman Catholic Church, and has such a visceral hatred of the Catholic Church that his religiously demented personality demanded that he put down in writing what was in his mind.When Boettner wrote this book it was published in 1962. Why he couldn't wait until the end of the 2nd Vatican Council (1962-1965) probably tells me that he had to put down in writing his pent up hatred before the Catholic Church, through the results of the conclave, changed any of his antagonisms. From what I have read about Vatican II it has changed the Catholic Church a lot, while still maintaining the core beliefs of the Catholic Church that go directly back to the time of Christ.Loraine Boettner did not die until January 1990, but he never wrote a direct rebuttal to this book. Which will lead you to ask WHY? The answer is simple: After the book was released it was clear that Boettner made a fool of himself, and to admit that he was wrong in his dates and other fantastic claims he would have been made to look like more of a fool.It was noted straight away that Boettner's book `Roman Catholicism' is full of false information and unsubstantiated claims. At the time of it's publication Boettner was already an author who had four previous books published. And for him to admit in a follow up book that he was wrong, would have had him put on a `Black List' of writers never to be published again, despite his Publisher being; The Presbyterian and Reformed Publishing Company. This publisher of Theological works is known for their theological bigotry, against any Church or organization that doesn't believe what they do, but especially against the Catholic Church. But it still does not answer the question why this book has been reprinted again, and who is responsible for the book being reprinted.In the introduction alone Boettner lists dates that are not accurate, not just by years or decades, but by CENTURIES! And he goes on to invent councils and conclaves that never happened. True, some of councils he lists did take place, but in referring to these councils and what was the major theological item that that council will be remembered for are totally inaccurate. To a theologically un-educated individual it seems that he is an impressive writer that took the time to investigate all he wrote is true and accurate, so naturally the reader assumes everything being written is true and correct.The one thing that got me to read Boettner's book in it's entirety is that in his introduction Boettner lists 44 items that he calls; \"Some Roman Catholic Heresies and Inventions\" and goes on to list the dates of their Adoptions over a period of 1650 years. To the un-educated individual this seems impressive, to start his book with such bravado. But with me Boettner was dealing with an individual who took the time to really investigate these `Heresies and Inventions.' No matter what were Boettner's thoughts as he wrote these `Heresies and Inventions' there were too many to hit the reader with at the very beginning of the book, and second they sounded too fantastic. In investigating these claims I found that every one of these 44 claims were not only un-substantiated, downright fraudulent and full of half-truths.There is an old saying that says that a man who tells lies, like politician tend to do, simply hides the truth. A man who tells the truth, like a military officer when questioned by his superior, is an honorable individual. But a man who tells half-truths, like Boettner, has simply forgotten where and what the truth is.It didn't take me long in reading Loraine Boettner book to realize that he epitomizes the old axiom that was used so successfully by Adolph Hitler. Boettner's claims are so fantastic that like Hitler, Boettner is one that thinks, by his writing; \"If you tell a big enough lie, People will believe it.\"Boettner tries to give the reader that he is an academic, when all he is, is a frustrated bigoted writer who is so jealous, and so scared of the Catholic Church that he MUST tell lies that are big enough that people will believe him.Just to give an example of the wild claims that Boettner writes to try to make the reader believe he is an academic, are his claims that the Roman Catholic Church did nothing to help defeat the spread of communism throughout the world and that only the Protestant nations of the world were the only catalysts in fighting Communism. Boettner even goes on to name countries like the United States, Canada, The Netherlands and Spain having spearheaded the fight against the spread of Communism.This again sounds to the reader that Boettner did a good investigative job in naming what he claims are predominant Protestant countries that were leading the fight against Communism.However I'm one who believes that statistics don't lie and one only has to look at statistics to show that in Canada 42.6% of the population is Catholic, as opposed to Protestants representing only 23.3% of the population. In the Netherlands Roman Catholicism is the largest Christian denomination, larger than all the other Christian denominations put together. *In the United States Roman Catholicism has a membership of 74,455,877 million persons, far outdistancing the closest Protestant denomination of Baptists whose membership in July 2010 was recorded at 32,591,991 million individuals divided into 19 different Baptist sects, with the Southern Baptist Convention being the largest with a membership total of 16,228,438. *Then we have Spain, who was been a very strong and supportive member of NATO, where 94% of the population of over 40,500,000 million people profess Catholicism as their Religion. *Finally in the fight against Communism, lets look at Poland where 89.8% of the population of over 38,500,000 million people are Roman Catholic.*During the cold war the government of this Poland may have been communist, but it was the courageous fight of the people of Poland that started the domino effect that eventually toppled every country in Europe that were members of the Warsaw Pact and at one time had a Communist government loyal to Moscow.*Bottner's total ignorance of how the communist system of government works shows out here. In the Marxist-Leninist Communist system of government only 10% of the total adult population were allowed to become `card-carrying' members of the party. Levin believed that the smaller the number of dedicated Communists that held the reigns of power would suffice to keep the country under the yoke of Communism.This is why we have countries like Poland, Hungry, East Germany, Bulgaria, Romania and Czechoslovakia, for example, where extremely small number of loyal Communists controlled the government while large segments of the population never belonged or supported the Communist system of government they had between 1945 and 1989.Hence you have seen uprisings starting in Czechoslovakia in 1948 against Communism, which ended when the President of Czechoslovakia was `pushed' out the window of the upper floor of the Hradcany Castle by Communist agitators to take over the government of that formally `free' country after World War II. Other uprisings against Communist rule were in Poznan, Poland in June of 1956, in Budapest, Hungary in late summer and early fall of 1956, and again in Czechoslovakia in 1968 only 2 months before the Olympic Games.Who can forget the look on the Czech athletes at the Olympic Games in Mexico City in the fall of 1968 when any Czech athlete was on the same stand to receive their medal with an athlete from the Soviet Union. Not only would they not shake the hand of the Soviet athlete, but actually walked off the stand if the Soviet athlete received the gold medal and the Soviet national anthem was played.All of these uprisings prior to 1989 resulted in the small minority of the people that formed the government of those countries having to call on the Soviet Union to send in tanks and the military from the Soviet Union to squash these uprisings.And this dynamic 'domino effect' was directly caused by the fall of the communist government in Poland, again a country whose population was made up of almost 90% Roman Catholics.The fall of the communist government of Poland was followed shortly afterward by the fall of the communist governments of Hungry, Czechoslovakia, and even the former communist state of the DDR, the Deutsche (German) Democratic Republic of East Germany, and eventually Russia herself in 1991.Do you remember that November of 1989 when the Berlin Wall came down?Even \"Republics\" in the old USSR split away from Moscow, leaving only the \"Republic\" of Russia on its own. Among the modern day countries that were created after the fall of communism in the former Soviet Union are: The Ukraine and Belarus, not to mention the formation of the three Baltic Countries that were all former \"Republics\" in the Soviet Union of: Estonia, Latvia, and finally Lithuania, who population is 79% Roman Catholic.**All these figures can be substantiated by referring to the \"CIA World\n",

      "When researching a subject one much read each side's point of view. Those who believe that the material presented in this book is an accurate representation of Roman Catholicism are mistaken.To truly learn about Catholicism why read a book by someone trying to refute it? Why not then read accurate information about Roman Catholicism such as the Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC). The CCC is cross referenced with the Holy Bible so one can read the Roman Catholic side of the argument.If in the end one still disagrees with the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church, at least that person went to the source for accurate information.For a side trying to refute a theory or in this case religious denomination it is unethical as a scholar to present a presentation of your opposing theory in what can be proceed as an unbiased way.In short if one wants to learn about Roman Catholicism go to the source, in this case the Catechism of the Catholic Church. If one wishes to learn about Fundamentalism one can read any number of works by several educated Fundamentalist writers.This is a poor work.(Also a note should be made that not all Catholics who believe in Papal succession and the Mass are \"Roman Catholics\" or Latin Rite Catholics; there are over 20 liturgical rites in the Catholic Church. Around 97% of Catholics are of the Latin Rite.\n",

      "I tried to listen to this story on CD, and aside from the story not being terribly interesting, I was surprised at Asimov's attitude towards religion. I suppose I shouldn't have been. He is a sci fi writer, after all. But I thought he was supposed to be a smart guy. He's not -- at least on this point.The basic outline of the story (at least the beginning -- I didn't make it all the way through) is that some guy predicts that the galactic empire is going to fall, so he tries to make provision to preserve technology so that the succeeding dark ages don't last as long as they otherwise might. Toward that end he gets a select group of scientists onto this relatively isolated planet where they can carry on their work, which becomes the invention and maintenance of a religion that's supposed to preserve certain technologies through the coming dark ages. In this religion the high priests understand the theory -- the technology and all that -- but the local priests and the people are duped into believing in some mumbo jumbo.It's as if you're supposed to picture some priest waving incense and saying prayers while he adjusts the knobs on the nuclear reactor, believing that it's God doing something while it's really just technology.I know that \"technology as magic\" and \"religion = magic\" are common themes in the sci-fi genre, but for some reason I expected better from Asimov. It shows a rather alarming lack of thought.Religious rituals are always geared towards the chaotic and the mysterious. There aren't religious rituals to cause the sun to rise, because it's regular and dependable, but there are religious rituals for storms and floods and harvests and childbirth and whatnot. Religion is also used to explain hidden things -- psychology, forgiveness, etc.IOW, religion is subject to criticism (\"it's not measurable\") in precisely the area where Asimov is trying to squeeze it. He's trying to make religion the mystical cloak for something that's regular, predictable and logical. It just doesn't work that way.If religious rituals had precise, measurable results, people would suspect that there's nothing religious or mysterious about them and they'd look for a material cause. Anyone who doubts that simply doesn't understand the religious mind, or hasn't been paying attention. Sure, there are gullible religious folk out there who'll believe anything, but the majority have half an eye out for tricks and deceptions.The very idea that you can hide technology behind a cloak of religious ritual is a rather silly science fiction writer's fantasy.Anyway, the story wasn't that compelling, and this \"religious cover for nuclear technology\" business was so incredibly stupid, I couldn't finish it.\n",

Foundation simply failed to ignite any spark in my imagination. The characters are poorly developed, largely because of the huge leaps in time throughout the book. In addition, the inability of a person writing sci-fi -- which by its nature looks to the future -- to envision any role for women in that future is deplorable. I thought Asimov's work trite, boring, and completely lacking in the sort of foresight that makes books by authors like William Gibson and Tad Williams so amazingly captivating.

But then, the politics took over and the Sci-Fi aspect was completely lost. This book felt like a drama class play that could have taken place anywhere and almost at anytime. I never felt like I was in space or that anything related to Sci-Fi was present. I didnt mind the story so much but being a Sci-Fi book means that I expect some technical \"sciency\" details and didnt get anything in this book. I also did not like the huge jump from each major chapter regarding time. Just when you feel that the plot and characters are \"settlling-in\" you jump 80 years and have to start all over again. Lastly, there was very little scene setup. I rarely knew where the dialog was taking place or what the surroundings were...hence the comparison to a stage play.If you like Arthur Clark's style of Sci-Fi like me and prefer the Science aspect of Sci-Fi to be featured in books you read then I would not recommend this book.

Dull, mostly pointless conversations between people you don't know as the story jumps quickly over time ruin this book. And how lazy of Asimov to not develop his ideas. At one point he gets out of this by having a character watch a movie that we can't see which describes something that would have been interesting and clever had it been developed.I guess I'll finish the series because I've heard the other books are better. Phew, glad I got this out of the way.\n",

I picked up the Foundation books because Asimov was supposed to be so great, and I really enjoyed his short stories. This book - all of the books in this series - is so amazingly boring it could be used to replace Thorazine. The concept was solid, but the characters made me not care at all. I kept hoping they would die simply so there would be something interesting happening. If you must read it, check it out from the library and save your money.

      "&quot;Foundation&quot; is considered by many SF devotees to be one of the greatest creations of the genre. It won the Hugo award to prove it, spawned many sequels, and even a couple of prequels. I was excited to read this book, expecting it to live up to its many accolades.Boy, was I disappointed!The basic idea of this novel is fascinating: Hari Seldon foresees the demise of the galactic empire using the science of psychohistory. He puts a plan into motion to lessen the catastrophic effect of this collapse. Will it work?This is a good concept to work from, and I liked the plot. It's classic SF.What I did not like was the writing.Asimov relies too heavily on dialogue. It reads like a play. The only narration present serves as &quot;stage direction&quot; to indicate that someone moves, or smokes, or exits, or whatever. I was not able to imagine most of what was going on, as Asimov never adequately sets the scene for us. People simply talk back and forth. Everyone talks excatly alike, and none of the dialogue sounds natural. With little attributions (he said, she said, etc.), it's often hard to tell just who is talking, anyway. It's an extremely frustrating experience as a reader.The other problem with &quot;Foundation&quot; (perhaps, its central problem) is that it tries to cover too much in too short a period of time. This is unfortunate, because, again, the premise is so good. A story like this must cover a great period of time to achieve its goals, of course. We have to find out if Hari Seldon was on the right track. Asimov introduces a host of charcters, but none of them stick around. Consequently, there's no one in the entire book that you know or care about. This is a major failing. A great SF novel cannot be just a clever idea. The great books of the genre have great characters who help us to understand and appreciate the clever idea. Look at &quot;Rendezvous with Rama&quot;, &quot;Ender's Game&quot;, &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;, &quot;Dune&quot;, or &quot;Brave New World&quot;. Each of these features great ideas and great characters.If this book were fleshed out a bit more with better descriptions and deeper characters who were actually given time to develop, I would like it much more. As it stands, it feels too thin -- it's the kernel of something really great.I recommend this only to die-hard SF fans who are getting back to the genre's roots, or those who value ideas over writing quality.I believe you must have both to be a true classic.\n",

      "I bought this book because Asimov is supposedly one of the sci-fi greats, but if this book is a good example of his work his reputation is overblown. I found the characters to be flat and one dimensional. The story uses unrealistic plot devices. Yes I understand that it's science fiction, but I find it strains credulity to think that the characters were able to invent a religion worlds-spanning religion in 30 years. It also didn't seem very likely that a 12,000-year-old empire would so quickly crumble into the stone age (I'm exaggerating slightly). I realize that this book was written in 1951 but the high tech stuff in the story was hardly high tech back then, much less in an empire spanned the galaxy.Bottom line: not an especially great read.\n",

      "Right where a character talks about his old age of sixty-two years.Yeah, right. An advanced galactic civilization, thousands of years old, with FTL travel and turnkey exoplanets just right for human habitation everywhere, never bothered to find medical treatments for aging. That might have sounded plausible in science fiction 60+ years ago, but much less so today. The novel also suffers from a lot of faults which other reviewers have noted. Perhaps Asimov's stories blew geeks' minds in the 1940's and 1950's, but his work hasn't aged well.BTW, Asimov, Heinlein, Clarke, Carl Sagan and a lot of other scientifically knowledgeable people in the mid 20th Century accepted the existence of exoplanets based on NO evidence at all until the mid 1990's, while at the same time criticizing similar claims without evidence as woo-woo. Just by coincidence the exoplanet faith position happened to resemble observable reality somewhat - but it didn't have to. Even then, the existence of so many \"hot Jupiters\" surprised a lot of astronomers involved in the hunt for exoplanets. Exoplanetologists may not find plausible earthlike planets for many years.\n",

      "The book is written about an empire in the future. I'm not really sure why Asimov thought that the future galaxy would be ruled by an emporer, which is a dying system of government, instead of a democratic republic. I know this is nit-picking, but I didn't like this book.Apparently, the future can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy using math and statistics. Anyone who works as a mathematician or statistician, as I do, knows that it's difficult to predict what's going to happen in anyone's life tomorrow, much less the entire world 500 to 1000 years into the future using statistics.This book is intellectual worship, which is something I can't stand. Intellectual worship is when people think they are intellecually superior to everyone else, so feel they should rule over everyone else, if only you would listen to them. This idea drips off the page as event after event is predicted by some really smart dude. This smart dude predicted a collapse of civilization and treated it as inevitable. Another idea that's patently absurd- that any event that occurs is inevitable.If this guy was so smart as to predict, with a high degree of accuracy, the downfall of civilization, and the rising of a new one, along with the traumatic events this new civilization would go through, why wasn't he smart enough to avert the downfall of the original civilization. Surely, with his predictive ability people would listen to him, but he decides to let it crumble for whatever reason.And Asimov is a mediocre writer. The story is only moderately interesting because no character really gets developed. I read this book because as a sci-fi fan, I felt obligated.\n",

To my surprise, I didn't like this book at all.I have read some bad books in my life, but this is the first bad book I bothered to read all the way through. I kept waiting for it to get better. I kept waiting for the \"eureka\" moment when I finally understood why everyone likes this book so much. It never happened, and when I finally came to the end of the book, I realized that Mr. Azimov stole a good two hours of my life and gave me NOTHING in return.The story sounds interesting, and in the hands of another writer it may have bore fruit. Unfortunately, in Mr Asimoz's hands, the story falls flat in the implementation. Had the writing not been funny, I would have been completely bored. Of course, Mr. Azimov did not intentionally make me laugh - sadly, his understanding of the human condition appears to be based largely on old, cheap pulp fiction novels. The characters are completely one dimensional and unconvincing. I truly cannot understand why anyone would like this book - but calling it a classic is simply unbearable.

With endless pages of dialog and few reasons to care about any of the characters, I had a very hard time getting through this one. And while I know it was written years ago, the author's science-fantasy was pretty much limited to \"nuclear powered devices.\" That just didn't feel like much of a stretch of the imagination, all things considered.I thoroughly enjoy sci-fi when told by authors such as H.G. Wells and Ray Bradbury. These authors know how to paint a picture in your mind and bathe your imagination in colorful imagery.

      "Foundation is the epitome of the ideal of the pessimistic technocratic utopian. Strange as it may sound, the plot is as follows: pseudo-science finds a way to predict future, politicians banish scientists, scientists establish new citizenry, trade flourishes, scientists gain control through pseudo-religion. This supposedly tried-and-true pseudo-science is a way to predict the future by way of studying human behavior (an oddly fatalistic view of a scientific universe). However, I disagree with the notion and invest my interest in the rival fund of the `Crazy Eddie' effect of Niven's Motie series where an individual can make the most drastic difference.I must further state that I was born in 1980 and began reading SF in 2007 with the likes of Niven, Bear and Brunner. I like my complex Iain Banks, voluminous Alastair Reynolds, mind-bending Greg Egan and ever-changing Brunner. Now while many of the so-called `old timers' have proclaimed Foundation sacred like the novels of Dune, I am of the new generation and of the new voice, which can't be held to the same standard as the last generation (or two). Times changes, ideals change, perspectives change, terminology changes, tolerable prefixes change and personal development changes. While Dune may have been impressive in style and scope, it did not satisfy me in content, interest and follow through. To these effects, I wish to express my dissatisfaction with Foundation.To paraphrase an excellent book about the relationship between psychology and musical composition entitled `Of Mind and Music,' the author states that repetition is an exploit of human emotion causing the listener (or in this case, the reader) to fall into a collective primal rhythm with fellow listeners (read: readers). Like in Foundation, the amount of repetition is akin to the acute attack of bass at a rave; theories are repeated endlessly, idiosyncratic allegories are scattered through every chapter and the word `atomic' was shotgun blasted, litter strewn, scattered to the winds, chucked without consciousness onto nearly ever page (sign of the times, I presume?). Here is the alphabetical list of `atomic' phrases found in Foundation:Atomic blaster, atomic drill, atomic drive (also the hyperatomic drive), atomic fire, atomic force, atomic force-shield, atomic gadgets, atomic generator, atomic knife, atomic power, atomic shear, atomic ships, atomic specialists, atomic techniques, atomic washing machine (bwah!) and atomic weapons.If `style' could mean the expressed use of repetition, the Asimov has easily seduced the science fiction reader of the early 1950s. With the blossoming (pessimists read: destructive radiation) of the atomic age, the dream of an atomic future must surely have seemed to be an optimistic fantasy. Nowadays, the equivalent would be novels which saturate their content with micro- and nano- prefixes. Thus, it seems as Asimov had the initial bug of beginning of the `atomic' prefix fixation? Did Asimov overdo it? In these regards, I stand to say that Asimov had a single-tracked mind.While reading the sciences and unfolding plot of the pseudo-science, I was constantly remained of the `Seldon crisis' and the mightier-than-thou proverb `Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent.' As an educated reader, I only need to be reminded once to have the full effect of conveyance and depth. Throw in the tame pre-sensor curses of `Oh, space!' and the cringe-worthy `Great galloping galaxies!' and you have for yourself a novel which is mildly aggravating, almost maddening. Repetition doesn't mean a solid follow through. Rather, it just means the author is either under-evaluating the reader of filling up word space.Additionally, the characters were as bland as cardboard for breakfast. Everyone seemed to be a utopian plutocrat or an idealistic capitalist in a struggling capitalist society. Scientists know best, so scientists so rule, right? It's ONE vision of style of government but the path Asimov takes is one of superiority and, ultimately, disagreement. The approach is too preachy to the benefits of an ideal technocratic civilization. Throughout, I understood the relationships and the dealings between opposing parties, but I found the unraveling as tedious as the usage of the word `atomic.' Politico scenes compounded by feudal titles bored me to bits, much like Herbert's Dune, Tepper's Grass and some of Wolfe's Long Sun series. While the over-all feudal scene works well with the future technocratic/religious society, I find the kowtowing to be overwhelming (more so considering I already live in a fairly visible feudal society).Inevitably, as the word and review suggest, I must say that the novel has failed to impress me in the year 2010 after 30 years of mortality and four years of reading science fiction. Surely, many modern novels must have been based off the ideals presented in Foundation, but from my standpoint in the ear 2010, I fail to see greatness which was intrinsically embossed upon it during its publication and further years of intense readership. In the year 2010, the novel does not stand the ultimate test of time.\n",

Recently, I picked it back up, and have had to revise my opinion somewhat.First, in terms of character and plot development, Asimov certainly hadn't hit his stride when he wrote these books. The characters are cardboard cutouts--especially the female characters.More importantly, Asimov uses the basic idea behind the series...that Hari Seldon created his &quot;psychohistory plan&quot; and launched it, invisibly determining the future of his Foundations for centuries...as a kind of magic box from which he pulls plot developments. This drains the story of dramatic tension. One knows from the get-go that it'll all work out in the wash. (In the second half of &quot;Foundation and Empire&quot; and &quot;Second Foundation&quot;, Asimov had found a way out of this problem, by introducing a wild card in the deck.)Finally, the book hasn't aged well. The technology forseen for his far-future galactic civilization seems positively &quot;retro&quot;. Normally, this wouldn't be a problem...Orwell's 1984 is still an effective piece of fiction, even though it's 2002, and the world is far different from the world Orwell envisioned...but the Foundation books' other flaws just seem to make this worse.\n",

A gun is an \"atomic blaster,\" and other quaint 50s relics.The one dimensionality of the characters is problematic. I have to admit that although I don't read a lot of science fiction, I know priority is never put on characterization. However, since nearly all of the ideas of the book are no longer relevant, this shortcoming becomes glaring. The book is more of a time capsule than a living book.There is actually a single main character who re-occurs as 3 different personas (Seldon, Hardin, and Mallow). SeldonHardenMallow is calm, calculating, and always right. His opponents flail around until the denouement when SeldumHardenMallow has maneuvered them into exactly the right position and emerges victorious. It's so predictable that there isn't any dramatic tension.The biggest problem I had with the book is that the politics seem very nave. This novel was supposedly based on Gibbon's \"The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,\" but Foundation seems to have only to most primitive understanding of that work.I don't really understand the love generated toward this book.

But the book in of itself is an extreme disappointment. I realize Asimov was young (21) when he wrote this, but his style leaves a lot to be desired. I'll take an early Arthur C. Clarke book over Asimov any day. This is the first book by Asimov I've read and I'm not sure I want to read another. His style is very dialogue driven with very few, if any, detail given to what the characters think. Everyone is very two-dimensional. And he never describes any of the scenes were all of this dialog takes place. Part of the interest in science-fiction is exploring new places, seeing different things. This entire story could have taken place on an empty stage. In fact, it seems like it's written more for a play than a novel. As for the story, it starts out interestingly enough. The Empire is going to crumble and to avoid thousands of years of dark-ages, a Foundation is set up to preserve the past learning's of the Empire. Well, that's what the original thought was at least. Soon we discover there's an alternate motive to this. Once we learn of this motive, the story goes straight downhill. Asimov skips decades from one page to another. Characters are introduced that we know practically nothing about, and he never tells us anything about them. I've read history books that had more character development than he gives the people in this book. By the time I got to the end I found myself saying &quot;So what&quot;?

Though having what initially appears to be a gripping plot, the grip loosens throughout the book. While philosophers may enjoy the lack of action and adventure, other readers who crave that amazingly described action sequence, will find that this is not the book to get. Taking place beyond the year 12,000 A.D, the Galactic Empire, spanning galaxies, is predicted by the revered physcohistorian, Hari Seldon, to crumble. On a mission to shorten a period of 30,000 years of barbarism after the fall of the Galactic Empire, to a mere millennium, he establishes an association, the Foundation, to preserve the Universe's knowledge in a giant Encyclopedia. Foundation takes place on many different planets in many galaxies across the universe. This book spans many generations and involves many characters, as the book covers in different plot lines that converge at the end.Foundation is a book that focuses on political issues, thus making the book void of action and adventure. This can make the book extremely boring and aggravating to some readers. The story focuses on conflicts among activist parties and groups conspiring against the political leaders of the Foundation's home world, Terminus, as well as diplomatic and religious conflicts between the Foundation's home planet, Terminus, and neighboring kingdoms such as Anacreon and Smyrno, along with greedy kingdoms bent on conquest of their neighbors. But out of the 285 pages of the book, there is only one significant action sequence, which is between the kingdom of Anacreon and the Foundation. The sequence involves a mass riot and uprising of priests on Anacreon's home world, along with the total emancipation of the Anacreonian naval fleet by a priest who threatens to curse the fleet. When characters, like the mayor of Terminus and his advisors, discuss war or the inevitability of a war, there never is an explanation of what occurs during the fighting, just a summary of the war, and who is the victor. An example is at the end of the book, when there is a war between the Foundation and the world of Korell, because of disagreements over religious beliefs and the tolerance of missionaries. The war is only summed up in an excerpt from the &quot;Encyclopedia Galactica&quot;. Another noticeable point about Foundation is how confusing it is in many aspects. The book is broken up into &quot;Parts&quot; that separate time, setting, and characters. A part entitled &quot;The Mayors,&quot; which takes place mainly on Terminus and involves the mayor, Salvor Hardin, and the relations between his world and the kingdom of Anacreon, is then followed by one entitled &quot;The Traders,&quot; which takes place many decades later and involves totally different characters in a different part of the galaxy. When and where each part takes place is not answered until later into the chapters of the part. Also confusing is the fact that new characters are introduced quickly in every part, thus making it harder for the reader to grasp. If the reader gets attached to a character or really likes where the plot and characters are going in a certain part, he or she will be unpleasantly surprised when those characters are never talked about again in the novel, after that part.One good thing about Foundation is that it expresses new and intriguing ideas about predicting the future through the science of psychohistory and what the human race and universe will be like in ten more millennia. This includes the idea of having a Galactic Empire that controls millions of planets. Along with ideas of nuclear power still being the most advanced power system, man-sized force fields able to block any nuclear handgun's blast and giant space ships with the capability to destroy planets are discussed. Also the ideas of monarchy being the prime governmental system is included in the novel. These may seem like interesting ideas that would make Foundation a great book, but the reader may find that these ideas also make the story harder to understand because they are either seemingly too primitive for the time period, or too far-fetched to be logical. This book could be someone's favorite book, if they happen to like philosophical books without action. It could also be the bore of a lifetime for some people.\n",

      "Disclaimer: I am judging this book as a standalone piece of work.Isaac Asimov's Foundation is the first of a series that would eventually be considered a cornerstone of the Sci-Fi genre. While it is certainly a solid piece of work, I don't quite understand how it is deserving of such praise. In my opinion, it suffers from an abundance of poor storytelling techniques, which reduce what is a great concept to a finished product that left me feeling empty. In fact, I struggled to finish the final pages, nearly racing through it solely for the sake of completion. I have rarely, rarely done this before. I'll start with the good aspects along with plot setup type-stuff first, and then finish with the overwhelmingly bad.The ideas and concepts behind Foundation are wonderful. The basis of the book is the work of Hari Seldon, the master practitioner of a discipline called psychohistory. If executed correctly, psychohistory has the ability to predict behavior of human beings thousands and thousands of years in advance through a combination of many disciplines, including mathematics, statistics, and psychology. It is, in essence, what modern day economics aspires to be. Being an economics major who currently works in the field, I found this to be highly compelling. In fact, it was from a blog post suggestion by Paul Krugman that I picked the book up in the first place.A bit more of the plot: Hari Seldon, the well-known psychohistorian, seeks to avoid an extended Dark Age, a period of 30,000 years in which barbarism runs rampant and tons of information is lost. His work in psychohistory leads to the establishment of the Foundation, which send ripples through the universe and ultimately attempts to shape its fate for the better. Hari Seldon is the first of a string of highly intelligent characters you'll meet, and Foundation is saturated with clever and thought-provoking dialogue amongst these characters. This, unfortunately, is where the good stuff ends.To say that this book is saturated with dialogue is a vast understatement. This book is 95% dialogue and it is the vehicle through which the story is told. This, I found to be abysmal. Even with an omniscient narration technique at hand, rare are the thoughts of characters, their descriptions, or an inkling of the settings on which these dialogues are taking place. One of the largest structural weakness of this storytelling style is that Asimov must infuse important details into his conversations. The problem with this is that these are details that would never come up in normal conversation. Thus, they come off as very awkward and ultimately serve to cheapen the dialogue. Not being able to get into the minds of characters leaves too much unsaid, which is the part of the cause of every section having the same structure: Person A is the plotter, Person B is the questioner. Person A knows something that Person B doesn't, Person B continually questions Person A about his plans, which all finally ends with a \"Don't you see?\" moment by Person A in which he explains his elaborately constructed conspiracy to Person B. This is the essence of every single section. By the time you get to the end, nothing is unexpected.And worse still, every single character is similar (except for one, who speaks with an accent and makes for a very comical section of the book). They are all intelligent, but not wholly different. Their lack of physical descriptions and thoughts serve to make them feel like the same lifeless replica of one another. The nature of the story, which causes there to be major gaps in time, make this even more egregious because just as you are getting used to one character, his section ends and a new character has replaced him. I felt zero emotion for these characters. As for the setting, this universe is not a living, breathing world. It is merely the outline of one, a skeleton of what could have been something magnificent. This bothers me. I am confident when I say that this book would have been absolutely stunning if Asimov had included 100 pages more of thoughts, descriptions, and settings.Some other small gripes: Asimov is prone to overusing adverbs, usually considered a literary sin. Foundation also has not aged well in terms of technology, as Asimov really misses on a lot of advancements that it seems other Sci-Fi authors were able to catch. I do not take any points off off this review for that, however, because the predictions he did make were far better than any I could have ever fathom, and I commend him in that regard. All I'm saying is that these misses, relative to other authors, aren't helping.\n",

      "Asimov is often said to have a flat style and to be unable to create credible characters. It's my opinion. And Asimov is never more ridiculous than when he writes about feelings, especially about love (scenes seem to be described by a child or a thinking machine). But this writer is still gifted at setting clever plots every reader will enjoy, for instance in his robots tales (of course do not expect more than a quality entertainment, as often with sci-fi). However, Fondation is not really a clever book ; it is not boring, but it has poor content. You will finish it but probably won't read it again. First problem, it is impossible to believe in psychohistory, which smells like positivist propaganda from the 19th century. And because he has nothing more than an adventure story to tell, Asimov uses all kinds of tricks to grip the reader, including lots of surprises justified by unlikely and twisted arguments, some of which you may find hard to swallow. To conclude, Fondation is a kind of cartoon : a succession of sketches, rather funny but unlikely. If you still absolutely want to read the book, don't read Dune before. As regards depth, writing, and imagination the two books are separated by lightyears.\n",

      "Recently finding myself with a lot of time on my hands after having just graduated school, I started picking up and reading a lot of the &quot;greatest&quot; works of science fiction. After having noticed all the editorials, reviews, and awards attributed to the Foundation series, I didn't hesitate to order all the books in the series. What a mistake! I'm not sure what people are seeing in these novels, but in no way do they even come close to approaching some of the other hallmarks of sci-fi, like Dune, Ender's Game, you name it. This book has a semi-interesting setup about trying to preserve civilization during a coming galactic dark age, but beyond that the book devolves into stupid scenario after scenario about how the Foundation is threatened but through the citizens' skill (i.e. sheer stupidity and dumb luck) they manage to somehow make it through the crisis only to face another yawner a few pages later. In between each crisis numerous years elapse, so by the time Asimov sets up the next unrelated crises, the entire cast of characters changes -- you barely have time to figure out their names much less get to know any person in significant detail.This series of books did nothing but put me to sleep on multiple occassions when normally if a book is good I'll stay up all night to finish it. My advice is to steer well clear from this series and try one of the other highly rated sci-fi books out there -- there are so many others that would be far preferable.\n",

      "I can understand why this book is considered one of the best science fiction books ever written, especially considering the time period it was written in. It has a very interesting concept of destination and cause and effect (although it is weak in execution and very weak in explanation). For these reasons and other I should only give this book a one star, but instead I gave it two and I will explain why later.There is almost zero character development in this book. The extremely short chapters jump thirty years to eighty years and more between chapters. Almost every &quot;book&quot; within this book has a new set of characters with only a few references of the &quot;heroes&quot; from the previous &quot;books.&quot; At times, this makes for very confusing reading because I had no idea who the new people were in the successive chapters.As mentioned in the title, this book suffers greatly from the Superman sydrome. By this I mean that you know the outcome before the events have unfolded. Superman can't be beat (except for by Doomsday in the comics but he comes back anyway) and therefor when watching the movies you know he wins. So there just has to be more elaborate plans and more complex ways of defeating him but he still will win. The same is true with the foundation. Harry Seldon, the prophet who esentially created the foundation, knew what was going to happen because he could see the future. Every &quot;book&quot; in &quot;Foundation&quot; will ultimately see the Foundation as the victor, so there just must be more complex problems arising, but of course the Foundation will ultimately prevail. And in this book, the problems are not really that complex, just different social economies arising to counter the previously established social economy that prevailed in the previous &quot;book.&quot; I can only imagine that in the later books the problems will get ridiculously complex - maybe even too complex for enjoyment.Because this book has almost zero characterization and is very predictable I would give this book one star, but instead I gave it two. The reason for this is because I have read the backs of the other books in the Foundation series and other reviews of them and I am interested in the storyline. I want to read about the Mule in Foundation and Empire, and I want to read about Earth in Foundations Edge. If not for that this book would recieve a one star rating from me and I would also never recommend this book or ever pick it up again.It may be a classic, but it's not that great.

      "I just finished reading Foundation and was extremely disappointed. Maybe I was expecting too much, something grander along the line of the Dune series. But the book in of itself is an extreme disappointment. I realize Asimov was young (21) when he wrote this, but his style leaves a lot to be desired. I'll take an early Arthur C. Clarke book over Asimov anyday. This is the first book by Asimov I've read and I'm not sure I want to read another. His style is very dialoge driven with very few, if any, detail given to what the characters think. Everyone is very two-dimensional. And he never describes any of the scenes were all of this dialog takes place. Part of the interest in science-fiction is exploring new places, seeing different things. This entire story could have taken place on an empty stage. In fact, it seems like it's written more for a play than a novel. As for the story, it starts out interestingly enough. The Empire is going to crumble and to avoid thousands of years of dark-ages, a Foundation is set up to preserve the past learnings of the Empire. Well, that's what the original thought was at least. Soon we discover there's an alternate motive to this. Once we learn of this motive, the story goes straight downhill. Asimov skips decades from one page to another. Characters are introduced that we know pratically nothing about, and he never tells us anything about them. I've read history books that had more character development than he gives the people in this book. By the time I got to the end I found myself saying &quot;So what&quot;? Am I supposed to continue on reading this series because it's been called a &quot;classic&quot;. I've seen the word &quot;classic&quot; thrown around a little too much sometimes.

      "In the book Fahrenheit 451 the main characters name is Guy Montag. Guy is a fireman that burns books and sets houses on fire instead of the normal fireman that puts out the flames. During the course of the book Montag goes through many different phases. The most important phase is where he starts wondering about books. Since all his life he has been taught that books are bad and only to burn them, he is curious what books are about. During the time that he is going through his mysterious phases he meets a girl named Clarisse McClellan, who opens her eyes to the emptiness of his life. Montag met this girl one night when he was taking a walk at about midnight. Montag also meets a very important character named Faber. Faber is an old English professor that likes books and knows a lot about them. Over the story Montag has Faber set him up with a retired publisher, to help publish books. At the time that Montag is trying to publish books the fireman are chasing him, because his wife turned him in.Guy Montag is a fireman who suddenly realizes the emptiness of his life and starts to search for meaning in the books he is supposed to be burning. He quickly forms unusually strong bonds with anyone who seems to have true friendship with him. His biggest regret in life is not having a better relationship with his wife. And because he didn't have a very good relationship with his wife that is why she turned him in to the fireman and got there house burned.The way that Ray Bradbury makes this book seem is incredible. He has a special talent that lets him really involve and capture the reader's attention. while I read this book I felt as if I was a silent observer that stood next to Guy Montag every where he went. I loved this book, and would definitely recommend this book to anybody who loves a great adventure and thrill.\n",

      "This summer we read this book. I hated this book for several reasons. First of all, the story was way too jumpy. It started slow, and then randomly got fast. It had absolutly no suspense to it. I found myself forcing myself to read! I couldn't relate to any of the characters! For instance, some of the characters were too boring. Maybe if I read this book in this book in ten years I would have a different opinion. Another reason why I didn't like this book, is because the characters weren't seen enough. They were all just thrown in at different times. You didn't feel like you got to know them very well and I hate that. I would not recommend this book. I think that Ray Bradbury needs to rethink his book ideas! I do not want to be critical of Ray Bradbury, but really I couldn't stand this book. It had no meaning to me. It also, had a poor plot and setting. For instance, it was plotted in the future yet it was no different than today. I don't plan on reading anymore or Ray Bradbury's books!\n",

They burn down the ones in which people have books; you may by thinking why would they care about books. Well, in this alternate future, books are illegal. I bet that this seems very ironic to you, but yes, it is a book about there being no books. I didn't like this book. I felt that that his writing style was very unusual. The author, Ray Bradbury, didn't have difficult sentences, but he did seem to jump around. He would never be very clear. Within each and every page he would jump around, or lose the readers attention by rambling on in an unorthodox style. If there were a prime age group for this book it would have to be junior high schoolers to high schoolers. That is probably because it is about that difficulty and this alternate future may be the most appealing to this age.\n",

      "First off, I have to say that the idea isn't that far fetched. It's hard to imagine that someone in 1953 could depict our life so close to what it is like today. Television seems to run our lives and less people settle themselves in books. I say this because I'm one of them, although I do enjoy a good sci-fi novel (ie. 1984, Dune, Brave New World). That said, I have to conclude that Bradbury did in fact write a flop! It is true what they say about how you can't buy a book by it's cover. I, just as many others, was encouraged to read from the title. The concept is excellent and to a point, realistic. What seems &quot;wrong&quot; with the book however is the lack of depth the other characters have. Clarise, the girl who turned Guy Montag's head in the other direction, who had great potential, dies in the begining of the book. Her death seems meaningless as a result of lack of depth... Mildred, Guy's wife, who turns in her own husband, also lacks depth. The second reason which makes this book a flop is the lack of a conclusion. Not to spoil the ending of these great literary pieces, but the main characters in 1984, Brave New World, and Dune either die, are defeated, or emerge victorious (not in that order). But in F451, Guy ends up roaming the lands with a bunch of Harvard and Yale hobos. The government, Big Brother, or whatever you want to call it, which was so obviously against him, couldn't care less if he existed. And Guy's cause failed to alter anything, other than relocating him to the woods. There seemed to be no major conflict. Sure, people will argue that the chase was a conflict, but it was not solved. Now, if this book was part of a trilogy, then maybe there is some reason to leaving the question unanswered to what was the purpose of Guy's puiny uproar. But the fact is that the book is cut short. It deserved a better ending or even a better beginning. Whatever the case I felt thirsty for more at the end of the book, I had many questions unanswered, like what really happened to Clarisse, was she killed by a racing car or was she hiding from the government too? Does Faber get in touch with those printing guys or is he caught by Big Brother? There needn't be a happy ending, but to deprive the audience of an ending of any type spells out B A D S T Y L E.\n",

      "If the book was written intentionally this bad so the reader would be driven to burn the book in some kind of elaborate ironic metaphor, then maybe I get it. But its not. Or maybe if it was written before the genre defining steps made in 1984. But its not. It is simply self delusional in attempting to convey an idea, plot or any form of characterisation.For starters, why did a fireman after 10 years of diligently loving his job suddenly realises the futile nature of his ways after listening to a girl talk rubbish for 2 minutes intervals over a 4 day period? Why is it OK to get high on drugs and drive 90MPH around everywhere, but not read a book about philosophy in case a conceivable minority gets offended!? And why are books banned but every other type of media isn't. The book seems to suggest its their inherently edgy content, so why just ban particular books? Why employ an entire emergency service to do this job? And most importantly, how could any of the technological devices be engineered with the risk of the fire department coming round your house at any given moment to burn it down if you dared read a single book!? This could be all be forgiven if it was written well or follows an interesting story, but it just fails in every sense of the word. I have no idea why this book got so famous, it is plain stupid.\n",

      "When looking for a book to read, do not pick this one. I give this book two out of five stars because I did not understand the language, it is irrelevant to the world today, and some parts of the book make no sense.The book Fahrenheit 451 is written by Ray Bradbury in the 1900s. It is about a fireman named Guy Montag, and is based in the future. But instead of putting out fires, like today, the firemen in this book do the opposite: burn books.I read this book about two months ago in English class. I have written an essay about many topics that come up from this book, and have done other things with it.First, this book is full of crazy metaphors and similes. I did not understand most of them. Some have nothing at all to do with any of the material or other parts in the book. It's as if you have to be super smart just to read and understand this book.Second, the author makes references to the book being how life will be in the future, but it is not. We are not obsessed with our TV's and being chased around by huge robot dogs. It makes no sense to say something like this, and then it not be true. I know he wrote this a long time and that is what he thought, but still.Finally, some parts of the book make no sense. Like the part where the main character seems to be talking to himself, but he actually isn't. I did not know this, and neither will most readers. The author should have made this clearer to the reader.Something I did find good in this book, however, is the fact that the author is very creative and is very good at writing action and suspense scenes. For example, when Montag, the main character, tries to cross this one huge street, and there as a car coming straight at him quite fast.I do not recommend you to read this book. You should definitely pick a different more interesting book to read, and one that will possibly make more sense than this one.Written by Kelsey Lamb6th period English\n",

Just how old are the people who make the school board decisions about what is considered literature? Are they just too lazy to find something newer...like written in the last half century?

But we will never reach such an extreme level, its simply a rediculous concept. I contest that we cannot worry about whether others are getting their daily dose of Shakespeare, Joyce or the Bible, and if we choose to read on our own, we will always have the chance to do so. I imagine that if you are reading this review, you don't run a high risk of losing interest in books in your lifetime.

At least the Martian Chronicles was creative, had an emotional core, kept me captivated. The only thing creative about Farenheit 451 is its title. It paints a blurry picture of a simply boring civilization. I found myself not really caring what happened to Guy and Mildred and all the rest. There is no real prophetic vision as there is in say, Huxley's Brave New World, which gives a vivid depiction of a fully-fleshed out and interesting futuristic world, unlike Bradbury's, which is quite similar to any modern town that would exist when the book was written. Also unlike Brave New World, F451 isn't even very compelling, as censorship nowadays is much less of an issue than the genetic engineering and other issues Huxley raises.

Unlike today, where firemen stop fires, their job was to burn books and houses they were in. It did not matter if there people in them or not. As the story developes, Montag becomes curious about what the prohibited books contain, so he steals them. Towards the end of the book he gets caught and becomes a fugitive. Although the book has a good message, it was extremely boring. It made us reflect on our own lifestyles, yet we didn't enjoy the way Bradbury wrote it. It was dry and basically boring. Yet the theme about finding our humanity and ourselves was eye opening. It made us wonder if our civilization will end up as Bradbury's novel depicts. Will we end up, so wrapped up in ourselves and our technology that we will no longer have time to love others and have a mind of our own?

      "The novel, Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury, is about a man named Guy Montag who is a fireman. Unlike most ordinary firemen, he starts fires instead of puts them out. He burns books. If anyone in their town is caught with even only one book in their house, he comes and set the entire house on fire and lets it all burn to the ground. After a while he meets a girl and starts to fall in love with her. However, she likes books, and she reads them. So, he tries reading a book and he loves it. Then he stops burning them and instead he reads them while they live together. One time his boss came to his house while he was reading his book and he had to hide it. While he was talking his wife was cleaning and almost found the book.At first I thought that this was going to be a pretty good book. It might be kind of exciting, being about burning books and all. Since I personally hate reading then hearing about someone that burns books caught my attention. It turned out to be another boring book.This book would be better suited for older adults that like to read. Books that kids are required to read should be fun and exciting books not any of these boring books. There are plenty of books out there that would be much more interesting to read than the ones that we do read.\n",

      "Well, basically what happens without all the boring details is there is this guy named Montag and he is a fire fighter. The only thing is, the job of the fire fighter is to start the fires rather than putting them out. Well one day when he has to burn this old womens house it really hits him hard because she refuses to get out of her house before they light it on fire. So the firemen end up burning her house, the books that were in it, and the old lady. That made him think that there must have been something in those books worth dying for. Then he met this girl name Clarisse who made him start thinking even more. So he sort of came to the conclusion that he really did not enjoy doing what he did for a living.\n",

      "Okay,first off I would like to say that I enjoy almost any book I read. This book has made it to the top of my &quot;burn this book&quot; list. Dont get me wrong, the idea was well thought up, but the book wasn't well written. First off, the book starts off with someone trying to commit suicide,and this character is saved even though she's totally wack. Second, the main character is named &quot;GUY MONTAG&quot;. How origanal. Third, the people in this book are IDIOTS! I mean, first they outlaw all &quot;offensive&quot; material, then they condense great novels into two page stories,and then they sit around on thier butt all day watching the &quot;family&quot; argue and OFFEND each other. The best character in the book simply dissappears in the middle of the book, and then she is found dead. Not only that but no one has friends. Not even your spouse is your friend. What kind of wack society doesn't have friends. This book needs to be re-written, and seriously re-done\n",

      "For the past few years, I've been reading a lot of \"classics\" (everything from ancient epics/mythologies/Arthurian legend/Matter of France to Chaucer/Shakespeare to Kant/Hegel/Kierkegaard to the 19th-Century Russian novels to Borges, Joyce, Woolf, Kundera, etc.), so I approached this work from a very literary perspective and with a reasonably solid foundation in literature. That being said, I am not entirely sure why this is considered a modern \"masterpiece.\" The concept is okay despite being derivative of earlier novels (of which, as has been said elsewhere, \"Brave New World\" and \"1984\" are prime examples, though I think he owes a fair amount to Kafka as well (and, given the relatively prevalent fear of totalitarianism/tyranny throughout history, probably many others as well)), but the execution is unexceptional to say--er, type--the least.I find the writing to be sophomoric and unpredictable: sometimes flowery metaphors or analogies are used without real purpose, and there are several unimpressive \"paradoxes\" (x is on fire yet x is also cold, y is living but y is also dead, etc.) producing the illusion of depth. What makes such rhetorical language so jarring, however, is that it is almost randomly thrown into an otherwise concise and straightforward narrative, as if Bradbury went back and tried \"spicing up\" his writing by thoughtlessly peppering it with unnecessary metaphors. (For example: early on, there is a paragraph discussing Mildred's eyes as \"moonstones,\" a poetical paragraph that was initially (for me) utterly confusing because it was totally unexpected and, considering the text within which it is couched, unfitting.) I can respect various registers and don't suscribe to New Criticism's imperative for self-contained organic harmony--I (eventually) loved \"Ulysses,\" which is neither consistent nor self-contained--but Bradbury's changes of style accomplish nothing but confusion, distraction, and perhaps an occasional \"how beautiful!\" from readers admiring a pretty but misplaced sentence.While the characters aren't developed with any depth, I can respect this decision: the protagonist becomes an \"everyman,\" the characters become symbols, the plot can unfold more rapidly, etc. Nonetheless, Bradbury is very heavy-handed with his symbolism and messages (even the ironic reversal of firefighters' duties is anything but subtle) and, despite the \"think for yourself\" message, it is almost as if Bradbury is a prophetic preacher telling you what to think. Thus, the novel lacks the nuanced depth of many great works of fiction. Likewise, the plot itself is presented sloppily and often seems contrived: a man who loves to watch books burn suddenly changes his entire outlook because of a few conversations with a teenager? (If the \"loving to watch books burn\" were written in free indirect discourse, then fine; Guy has hidden books in his house, slightly unsettled, but still *thinks* he likes burning books. But the narrative appears unilaterally third person limited.) Books must be burned, but there is no mention of paintings, movies, musical pieces, and other art/media, so what happened to those? How, exactly, did culture go from minorities/over-commodification/instant gratification to \"we must burn every bloody book, dammit!\"? Moreover, the dialogue is not believable--it feels unnaturally fast, especially Guy's interactions with Faber--and it seems artificial, tailored to further the plot even at the expense of conversational logic.While not always disappointing, overall the writing gave me the impression that it was written by a smart and overeager high-schooler, not a literary master. The book has its audience, but those expecting/hoping to find a modern literary \"masterpiece\" will be sorely disappointed.\n",

      "I feel almost guilty giving this book a review like this, it is hailed as a classic and usually when I read books that are considered classics I can see the many strong qualities that put them on the 'classic' pedestal. But I must be honest, I'm not going to make this book sound better then I thought it was simply because it is considered a classic. The only redeeming quality this book really has is the overall idea and like many reviewers have already pointed out - the idea is good, the execution of said idea is quite lacking.This story follows Guy Montag, a fireman. Unlike the firemen of today, these firemen burn books rather than put out fires. The world has become a dystopian society that favors pleasure over reality. We almost have a 'stepford-society' of sorts. Critical thinking is said to create sadness and conflict so something must be done about it. The books must be burned.In Fahrenheit 451 Montag has an epiphany after talking with his light-hearted neighbor Clarisse. Clarisse represents the very thing this society is trying to rid. Guy Montags wife represents the opposite. You can already see the conflict here, so what is Guy to do?I'll admit the first 40 pages or so really had me going. The story was unique and the message was interesting. I did notice right away that Bradbury likes to be overly-poetic in some parts, and a straight-shooter in others. His writing is a little inconsistent but I was able to look past that. At first I really hated Montags wife (a good thing, when books conjure up these types of feelings then they are doing their job) and I really felt empathetic towards Guy. The problem is that this book really started becoming silly. The characters really become forced and the plot as a whole takes an eye-rolling turn for the worst. The ending is one of the most forced endings I've ever read. This book could have been written a million different ways and Bradbury chose a really silly path. I had to force myself to finish the book and I started to lose my feelings towards the main characters, I just started to not care anymore. It's almost as if Bradbury had a good idea for a short-story one day and forced it into a novel.In the end I would give this book a 2.5/5. There are some interesting ideas and some of the writing is pretty good, though it is inconsistent. Unfortunately I can't give half-stars so it's either a 2 or a 3. Tough choice but ultimately this book was more on the disappointing end of the spectrum for me.\n",

      "Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury, takes place in a futuristic society where reading books, or the written word, is against the law and if you get caught all of your belongings, house and all, get burned to the ground.Even though this book is completely unrealistic to our society and has firefighters burning down homes instead of saving them, it offers an insight to what live would really be like if there was no written word and if technology ruled our lives.Guy Montag, the main character and our look into the firefighting world, is a man content with his life and never thought of the right and wrong of his job until one day when everything goes wrong and he feels that his freedom is being oppressed.This novel contains some action and it better reading for an older reading audience but will be liked for years to come.\n",

      "I really did not enjoy this book at all. I felt that the plot was hard to follow and somewhat confusing. Some people have said that this book is written for high school students, but I really don't think that it is. I'm a freshman in high school and I really did not understand what was going on. I figured it out enough to kind of follow the story, but definitely not enough to actually get into the book. This is one of only about 3 books that I have ever read that I did not perfectly understand and enjoy. The basic idea of the plot is that Guy Montag, a fireman in the future, is paid to burn down houses that illegally store books in them. He meets some other characters (such as Clarisse, a 17 year old who lives in his neighborhood) who help him open his eyes to the world that he is being so blind to. If you enjoy reading about censorship or science fiction, this book might be okay for you. If you like stories that are pretty easy to follow and have a more realistic plot, don't bother. -- luckiestarre\n",

      "This small book starts off nicely with a \"Fireman\" name Montag walking down the street. This takes place in the future where books are banned, and fireman set fires to houses with books. It's a world where the government controls everything, and people are content watching television. As Montag walks he encounters a strange girl. A inquisitive teenager who tends to slowly open Montag's eyes to the life that himself and the government has tried to prevent him from seeing.However, the book goes downhill from there. We later learn that the girl died, maybe or maybe not by the government. Then all forms of subtlety are thrown out the window. Montag burns a lady and her house down, but only after picking up a few books. He starts a conversation with a former literature professor, who discusses how the government and people disengaged themselves from the world of literature, and how to change their thinking. The worst part was when his fire chief enters his house and gives the typical bad guy expose to the good guy on what the government is trying to do. This dialogue is extremely forced and contrived and quickly bores the reader along while taking away much of the imagination of the what and why.He later kills that fireman and goes on the run after his house burns down, only to be left in a the countryside as a survivor, and tries to resurrect the world of books and open thinking. This again overtly ties into an over the top message on the good of literature and open-mindedness.For those who value subtlety and imagination, this book is not for you. While I respect and admire Bradbury's plot and perspective, it could have been done in a much more presentable, believable, thought provoking, and by far more engaging way.\n",

      "I read the book Fahrenheit 451 for English class and was not impressed with the way the story was written. In general, the book is about censorship. It is the story of a society where books are outlawed because the lead to conflicting points of view, offend minorities, and cause confusion. Firefighters have the job of finding 'criminals' who are hiding books in thier homes and burn the books.I found this book to be boring and unexciting. There was very little description and this led me to be confused about several parts of the book. A few of the repeated aspects of the story were never fully described which led me to be unsure of what exactly they were. For example, the seashell radio that Montag's wife Mildred uses. A little more description would have made me understand more clearly, what it did and said. I was also confused about what the 'family' was that Mildred and her friends were constantly watching on the wall. These details of the story made me lose interest in the book. I also think that the reason for banning books was not made extremely clear. More solid reasons should have been given, other than the vague explanations.Another fact that I found annoying was that houses were fireproofed in this society. That is why firemen as we know them were not needed any longer. Therefore, it seems to me that the firemen in the book should not have been able to burn the houses of the people hiding books.The most exciting and best part of the book came at the end when Montag had escaped from his old world and was living with intellectuals away from civilization. Montag and his new friends survive an attack during a war and set out to rebuild the world. Although this book ended better than it began, I do not recommend it.\n",

      "I have infinite patience when I am personally pretentious, self-absorbed, and dull. I don't have the same patience when I read books that are that way, though.The story is about a futuristic world where knowledge, thought, and argument have been banished in favor of momentary happiness, thrill, and pleasure. The protagonist, Guy Montag, is a fireman. In the future, instead of fighting fires, they are in charge of lighting them. They are the front line defense for society against the societal decay caused by books, so their job is to go around burning down the houses of those who own and read books. Montag, at some point, realizes the importance of books and instantly becomes an enemy of the state, a target of the same department that he worked for.One problem with this book is in the fact that Bradbury can't create a realistic world in which these events could become a reality. Granted, he was writing 50 years ago, so he wouldn't have had knowledge of the type of entertainment which exists today, but all he seems able to conjure up is the concept of immediate, personalized entertainment as if that is the only type of entertainment that would remain. He creates a world (or just a city, because this type of environment only seems to exist in the city) where people are zombies sitting in their homes surrounded by television screens that are running all the time telling the people what they should think and feel. Conceptually he wasn't wrong, it's just his clumsy handling of the telling. He can't create a solid series of steps that lead from the present day to that future (though he tries). He can't recreate the sort of television show that these people would watch, and he can't explain clearly why anyone would want to watch it.Beyond the setting, the characters themselves are one-dimensional. They are all archetypes, and none have the spark of life which would make them interesting. Clarisse, the dangerous intellectual adolescent; Montag, the newborn Man whose eyes have recently been open; Faber, the reluctant wise man; Beatty, the hardened symbol of the State, who is a very capable parry to the thrusts of Faber; none of the characters have any depth whatsoever.The writing itself was a pain to read. Bradbury can't seem to figure out which word he needs to use, so he opens a thesaurus and dumps as many words as he can onto the page. In addition, he wanders off on tangents without bringing those tangents back to the main storyline. Furthermore, his dire need to make his point (a panoply of ideas is good, not bad) by either having the characters themselves soliloquize it, or by doing it himself in wandering, dull monologues. This is the sort of self-absorption I allude to in the title to this review.To drive home the fact that Bradbury thinks he's God's gift to knowledge, the afterword and coda and interview with the author leave nothing to the imagination. According to Bradbury himself, he's got tons of ideas of how to make the story better. None of those ideas have to do with improving the writing, just making each character's monologue longer. He claims to refrain from adding those updates to this edition of the book (50th anniversary edition) because he feels the original text, as the author wrote it, is pristine and perfect. His contempt for editors is plainly spelled out at various places in the tacked-on content.I really can't recommend this book to anyone who has already graduated from high school. The story is poor. The writing is poor. The author's point is all it's got of value, and even that is nothing special. It may be helpful to know the character of Guy Montag in case it ever comes up in conversation, but other than that, I can't think of any reason to spend time with this book. 2 stars\n",

It was basically don't watch TV, read books. The world will be lost without them! And the whole thing about the stupid Harvard degrees on the railroad tracks was cheesy and stupid. If you can memorize a piece of literature so easily, what's the point for books? I compared this book to Orwell's 1984, which I read last year, and there was no comparison. This book was not nearly as chilling and thought provoking and failed horribly in getting it's point across. With all the talk of firemen burning books, you were tempted to put a match to this one. I also disagree with a major point of the book that implies with the loss of literature comes the loss of morality. The book took place in the future but not that far in the future. I got the idea that it took place only one or two generations after it was written. The morality of the world could not be lost in that amount of time.\n",

      "The book Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury in my opinion is extremely confusing and difficult to read. The setting is in a futuristic world, where books are banned and anyone who is caught with books are prosecuted. The main character, Montag, is a fireman whose job is to burn books. The world he lives in is plain and dull, and he becomes desperate for something exciting, so he begins to read the books that he burns. Once caught by his fellow fireman, Montag must flee from his home and run away to escape imprisonment or possibly death. In the book, some of the concepts are hard to understand, and the futuristic conceptions in the book may confuse the reader. The vocabulary isn't too difficult, but there are sections of the book that may set the reader off track. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone younger than the seventh grade level, and I would recommend this book to people who like science-fiction. Personally, I thought this book was very boring and it didn't capture my interest.\n",

      "The story of Fahrenheit 451 is a complicated one that tries to explain the future in an odd way that is not often expressed. It brings you into the warped mind of a fireman, who burns books rather than puts fires out. This book proves to be very novel and is interesting at times, but at other points it just seems boring and outright ridiculous. When I read this novel it made me think of what the present day government might do behind our backs to censor certain materials, but the novel can be so confusing that it is hard to find the relationship. Despite these setbacks, it shows how a few wrong moves and decisions by humans today can end up in grave results in the future.In this story, the main character Montag begins to run into people that alter his mind and make him think about the ethics of his job, which of course is burning books. Montag used to live his life smelling of kerosene, ravaging people's houses, and setting books aflame, but he wants to know why he is doing these deeds in the first place. It is sort of difficult to see how books could be so horrible that they should be banned and burned. You learn later in the story, if you can read inbetween the lines of difficult language, that the government has put a ban on all books to prevent them from corrupting the minds of the people living at the time. Montag learns this and begins to live two lives; one as a fireman, and the other as a madman hiding books in the vents of his house. While this is happening a war is going on that is so hard to understand and so irrelevant that it should just be ignored. The book continues to become more confusing, and the end is just unimaginable and pointless.If you love books that are outdated and totally science fiction, then this is the novel for you. It is a great piece of work that was new and exciting when it was written, but to most people today it would just seem odd and nauseating at times. It is totally unbelievable, and it was difficult for me to sit down and read this story because it was so complex and involved. It takes a person with an extremely vivid imagination to read this novel. It was meant to show how people can not let the government get out of control because they will eventually corrupt and control the minds of every last person on the planet, but this point is lost somewhere amongst the many plots and twists. It tends to be very odd take on the subject, and I would not really recommend using your time to check it out.\n",

I was forced to read it for my 8th Grade AP English class and wasn't very thrilled about it. Bradbury goes on for pages of poetic nonsense that many don't and wouldn't want to understand. The book has a wonderful message and I am disappointed in Bradbury for this horrible representation of such a wonderful theme. Too many questions left unanswered for the mind to ponder. I mean who doesn't like thinking about a book?? Well I certainly do but there are just too many loose ends. And the characters aren't elaborated on enough. They are almost all left as flat charachters which doesn't make for a most enjoyable book. Many have read and many have been disappointed.

I found it very boring because of the way they went from one event to another without really tying them together. Also,the way the author compared the characters thoughts to real life examples most of the time didn't make very much sense and sometimes you couldn't tell the difference between something really happening or if it was all in their mind. From the start it did not seem to be going anywhere. I would not suggest this book to anyone of my age or anyone interested in adventure books, because this isn't.

His premise is interesting enough, especially in light of the present state of our culture, however his execution is embarrassingly bad.The plot is predictable and hoaky, the characters are boringly flat, and the dialogue--perhaps the biggest drawback of the book--is wooden and unrealistic. Interspersed throughout all of this soap opera melodrama are dreary, quodlibetic references to Shakespeare, Bacon, Milton...you get the picture.It dawned on me as I was nearing the end of this book that Bradbury could easily have been the child of Ayn Rand and Jacques Barzun. Hamfisted, cardboard fiction from mommy, and tired pedantry from daddy. To be fair, there are a few well-penned lines, and he definitely has a point. But if you're interested in nightmarish visions of a futuristic dystopia, check out Orwell or Huxley. Bradbury basically took their stories and mashed them together anyway.Again, I can't stress enough the importance of this book's message. Nevertheless, this book, as vehicle for that message, definitely has a flat tire.\n",

      "If you are looking for a story about a dystopian society in which the government censors people's entire lives to the point where citizens aren't even allowed to read, then Fahrenheit 451 the perfect book for you. In the book, Guy Montag is a fireman who burns down houses with books hidden within them. He starts out really dedicated to the job, but then he meets a girl one night walking home from the fire station that really gets him thinking about how he is living his life. Guy begins to rethink everything he does and decides to fight the system. The idea of the story is fantastic; however the writing is not the greatest. The way Ray Bradbury writes is highly confusing. He uses metaphors, symbolism and similes like there is no tomorrow. He also has a tendency to jump from one topic to the next, one time to the next and one mood to the next. When he is talking about the Salamander when going out on a call to look for, and burn books, he describes the Salamander in great detail and then just switches to talking about the house, at which they have just arrived, without saying anything about the house until after the explanation of the house. So while the reader thinks Bradbury is still describing the Salamander he has actually gone into talking about a house instead. All in all, the book had a great point being that if someone challenges you; challenge them in return for what you believe to be right and just. However the style of writing just didn't agree with the way my mind thinks. But if you are someone who enjoys metaphors and jumpy writing, this would be a good choice for you to look in to reading.\n",

The themes of ignorance, gleeful mass-media mesmerism and inner conflict are better represented in their works.If you understand doublespeak, give this one a miss. It's double-plus-ungood.\n",

      "Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury...all I can think of is hard to believe, boring, and extremely hard to follow. This story takes place in a place that is supposed to be in the future where books are restricted and illegal. Firemen did not go to set out fires, but to light books on fire. The main character of this story is Guy Montag, who is a fireman. He becomes friends with an odd girl named Clarisse. She changes his mind about his job and how life should really be. Television is more important than family in this story, and Montag's wife, Millie, refers to the people in the television as her `family'. This book was very original and out of the blue and also creative. Ray Bradbury's writing style was very interesting. He used a lot of skilled vocabulary that was confusing, and the whole book was like a jumble of words that were hard to understand. Some of the ideas in the book did not really pertain to the book's plot. I would definitely not recommend this book to anyone below the seventh grade. I am a seventh grader in Massachusetts and I hated this book. I didn't like it because it was so boring and it goes really slow. Fahrenheit 451 is this kind of book that makes you feel like reading it was a whole waste of time because it was so boring and pointless. I would recommend this though to people above the seventh grade who like science fiction book. If not, this book is not recommended at all by me.\n",

By page 3 of the novel, however, I knew this was not a book I would enjoy. While it's a frightening, though thought-provoking look at the way society could become, it was extremely badly written. Bradbury goes on and on for pages of nonsense, and his words leave you with no more enlightenment than you had 50 pages ago. He uses redundant adjectives, and pointless sentences. I was especially annoyed when he would go &quot;inside&quot; Mr. Montag's thoughts and repeat the same meaningless phrases over and over again.

      "I picked up this book because I had absoutely loved Huxley's Brave New World and Orwell's 1984. I thought I would like this book, considering its subject matter. I was completely wrong. Those that compared this to the other two masterpieces, failed to note one thing: Whereas the other two are written in haunting, intense, breathlessly engaging style, this book is in comparison rather choppy in its language. If the language style was not so dry, maybe I would have enjoyed slightly more. Furthermore, the book lacks any suspense whatsoever. Instead of staying up all night by my bed to finish the book, I had to constantly skip pages because of its rather boring and dry writing. I also found the characters particularly unsympathetic and unable to identify with. Instead of drawing me in, I had to force myself to finish the book (after repeatedly skimming through some unbearably slow sections). For such a small book, it's not easy to turn off a reader so many times. In addition, the book feels distant and unrealistic. It misses the realism to resonate with today's society, but it also lacks the bleak prophecy of a warning. Instead, near the end of the book, the author gave a not very subtlely disguised lecture on censorship, which is fine, except for the face that it feels like the author had left the world of storytelling and abruptly intrude into his own stories. He could not get the point across by the story itself; he had to announce it out. I also found the ending a bit ridiculous and incredulous. If words were so easily preserved in memories, we would not need writing. If the brain were so indiscriminating in its selectivity, we would not have conflicting memories. And although this book was supposedly an anti-censorship novel, I did not walk away from this book feeling the horrow of censorship. Instead, I wished I had not wasted my time on reading this book.\n",

But Farenheit's story is clearly &quot;too much&quot; inspired by Orwell's and Huxley's work, with too obvious similarities hard not to be comparable at the same time you go through the book. An example, Farenheit's big televisions on the walls in the houses. Remember Big Brother speaking from wallscreens in 1984?On the other side, Bradbury let us know that books are synonims of &quot;culture&quot;, and &quot;development of thinking&quot;, which in my opinion are arbitrary statements. There can also be non educative books as there are non educative tv programmes or popcorn movies.And the story changes its course abruptly at the end. The characters that didn't die are running madly across the forests, with an ending that is hardly convincing.My advice would be not to read this book, at least if you've already read those other two...\n",

      "Reading this book could be compared to watching a train being derailed while high on shrooms. The very definition of convolution, this book is confusing and ultimately pointless.Our hero, Guy Montag, hardly makes a compelling main character. We know him as little more than a book-burner who begins to have doubts about his task. That's it. Period. Beyond that, he's not developed at all in the ample page space provided. Any other characters have just bit parts and are painfully obviously killed off as soon as the author doesn't need them anymore. It seems Bradbury has misjudged his own timeline, however; many characters, especially Clarisse McClellan, could have been part of a great supporting cast if they hadn't been gotten rid of when he did.Getting back to that \"pointless\" bit - well, that's just it. I honestly did not take away a single thing from this book. It was completely and utterly uninformative, and the only way it made me think was to try and figure out where the characters where and what they were talking about. An issue in and of itself, the dialogue in Fahrenheit 451 is so heavily-laden with metaphors, and the parts of conversation passed so often between different characters, every time I discovered what they were talking about was a treasured moment. Anyway, the book doesn't tell me anything. Guy Montag has doubts about his job, and runs away. Ok. So? So what? Why do I care? This had great potential to be a commentary on the suppression of individuality, but like many other possible routes, that thought had been thrown away in favor of... well, whatever this book turned out to be.An exercise in idiocy, this book should not be read by anyone who values his or her time. You won't learn anything and will ultimately be puzzled as I was when you reach the end of the book. Yet another \"classic\" that doesn't deserve the title.\n",

After plowing through Bradbury's self-aggrandizing Foreward AND Introduction, I was ready to be enthralled. No such luck. This had to be one of the most abysmal books of all time. I suspect there's a bit of The Emperor's New Clothes (a much better read, by the way) going on here. In other words, if you dare to criticize Bradbury, then you must be one of the mindless rubes who hate books and philosophy and creativity and yadda yadda yadda. Fine, whatever. To put it delicately, this book stunk like yesterday's diapers. I have nothing but sympathy for the poor students who are forced to read this drivel for class--at least I had the option of putting it down. I am a college English major and a Senior Editor at a major publishing house, as well as an avid reader. Bradbury's over-the-top vision of intellectuals being rebellious outsiders who are hunted down is hilariously vain. His celebration of intellect above all else excludes other virtues such as love, compassion, humor, etc.. Interesting how these themes are given such short shrift. Bradbury is an overheated, macho, pseudo-intellectual with a chip on his shoulder.

      "Ray Bradbury's 1953 novel Fahrenheit 451 is a science fiction classic that, somehow, I'd never read. With Bradbury's recent death, I decided it was time to remedy that. Unfortunately, I was severely underwhelmed by Fahrenheit 451, and found it lacking in many ways.Fahrenheit 451 is a dystopian novel that, despite prominently featuring book-burning, posits dystopia-by-entertainment, like Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, as opposed to dystopia-by-oppression, like George Orwell's 1984 or Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale. The evil of the Fahrenheit 451 is not censorship, but television, which has made people so dumb and uninterested in the world that (almost) no one even cares that firemen now burn books, instead of putting out blazes.The main character is Guy Montag, one of these firemen, who, after a few chance conversations with a young girl next door, realizes he's doing bad things and that the world is a mess. This pushes him to start to consider reading the books he's supposed to be burning, and the novel moves on from there.Montag, and the other characters in the book, all seem flat. Part of this is that there's no real dialogue or conversations in the book. With the exception of Guy's horrid wife and her friends who basically say \"Shut up, my shows are on!\" all book, every time a character opens their mouth, it seems they launch into a diatribe - the protagonist and his allies for books, and the antagonists against them. There's no real debate of ideas, and the characters all seem like mouthpieces for Bradbury, either for his anti-technology position or straw men for the anti-book position.The idea of a dystopia brought on by entertaining the citizens into apathy is a perfectly good one, and Huxley did a fine job with it in Brave New World. However, I just couldn't buy Bradbury's take. As far as he's concerned, technology can only be used to placate the masses through their wall-sized TV's or proto-Walkmen. In Fahrenheit 451, the means of content creation still rest, as they did in the '50's, in the hands of the few. This fails to account for the way technology really played out. Sure, we all have huge HDTV's and smartphones with Bluetooth headphones, but we also use all this fantastic technology to connect with people around the world in ways never before possible, and we seek out alternate sources of information that could never have reached nearly as as many people. Sure, plenty of people just let TV rot their brains, but I'm not convinced that's any different today than the '50's, and the technology now has so many other fantastic and worthwhile uses Bradbury ignores or can't predict. Bradbury also ignores that a large percentage of books aren't any better than TV. Just because it's printed on a dead tree doesn't make it Plato or Dickens.Let me also say something about the end of the novel and the war background thread. All through the novel there's imminent threat of war, though - perhaps this is to reflect the characters' lack of concern - what the war is about, who it's with, or how it will be fought is never really addressed, until the end of the book. All of a sudden, it pops up in a major way, and then a page or two later the book's over. It's like Bradbury ran out of story and decided \"Eh, I'll just toss in a mention or two of war earlier in the book, then let that take care of everything at the end.\" Maybe this is related to the fact that Fahrenheit 451 started as a short story, was expanded to a novella, then expanded again to a novel. Maybe there just wasn't enough story to flesh the ideas out to that long a format. In any case, the war thread is a horrible deus ex machina (see 1984 for how to weave war into a dystopian story effectively), and the ending is almost a non-ending. I don't mind a grim or ambiguous ending, but Fahrenheit 451 can't even deliver in that way.The writing style also gave me problems. Bradbury goes on for paragraphs describing scenery in repetitive flowery language, then in a plain sentence or two you hardly notice, he slips in a major event with little emphasis. It's just uneven, tedious, and makes things hard to follow.I love golden age science fiction from Isaac Asimov and Robert Heinlein, so it's not that I don't enjoy the genre or the era. Yeah, 1950's science fiction has its issues these days, but I don't mind those too much, as writers like Asimov an Heinlein penned entertaining stories with lasting messages. I know Bradbury is looked at in a similar way, but from Fahrenheit 451, I just can't put him in the same class as Asimov or Heinlein.I listened to Harper Audio's 2001 production of Fahrenheit 451, ready by Ray Bradbury. I thought it would be interesting to hear the book as envisioned by the author. I was wrong. Bradbury was not an effective narrator. He has a single tone in which he reads. It can be hard to tell if he's narrating description or reading dialogue, or if he's reading dialogue, which character is speaking. Conversations (such as they are, see above) are horrible to try to follow. I just can't recommend anyone, even a hardcore Bradbury fan, listen to this production. There are other versions out there read by professional audio book readers. Get one of them. It has to be better. One other problem with the production are the track times. These are rarely worth mentioning for audio books, but in this case, they are. The tracks range from 1:37 to 28:37 in length, and for no apparent reason. Tracks aren't tied to chapters or anything else I could discern. They just vary wildly in how long they are, which makes it very hard to keep track of where in the book you are. There's no reason for this. The production includes a 2001 interview with Bradbury after the book itself. The entire production runs approximately 6 hours, and about an hour of that is the interview.I can't recommend Fahrenheit 451. Yes, it has an interesting premise, but Bradbury just isn't up to turning it into a compelling story. If you're looking for a good dystopian novel, you'd do better to read 1984, The Handmaid's Tale, or Brave New World. And if you still want to read Fahrenheit 451, do not under any circumstances listen to Bradbury's narration of it.\n",

      "The story of Fahrenheit 451 is a complicated one that tries to explain the future in an odd way that is not often expressed. It brings you into the warped mind of a fireman, who burns books rather than puts fires out. This book proves to be very novel and is interesting at times, but at other points it just seems boring and outright ridiculous. When I read this novel it made me think of what the present day government might do behind our backs to censor certain materials, but the novel can be so confusing that it is hard to find the relationship. Despite these setbacks, it shows how a few wrong moves and decisions by humans today can end up in grave results in the future.In this story, the main character Montag begins to run into people that alter his mind and make him think about the ethics of his job, which of course is burning books. Montag used to live his life smelling of kerosene, ravaging people's houses, and setting books aflame, but he wants to know why he is doing these deeds in the first place. It is sort of difficult to see how books could be so horrible that they should be banned and burned. You learn later in the story, if you can read inbetween the lines of difficult language, that the government has put a ban on all books to prevent them from corrupting the minds of the people living at the time. Montag learns this and begins to live two lives; one as a fireman, and the other as a madman hiding books in the vents of his house. While this is happening a war is going on that is so hard to understand and so irrelevant that it should just be ignored. The book continues to become more confusing, and the end is just unimaginable and pointless.If you love books that are outdated and totally science fiction, then this is the novel for you. It is a great piece of work that was new and exciting when it was written, but to most people today it would just seem odd and nauseating at times. It is totally unbelievable, and it was difficult for me to sit down and read this story because it was so complex and involved. It takes a person with an extremely vivid imagination to read this novel. It was meant to show how people can not let the government get out of control because they will eventually corrupt and control the minds of every last person on the planet, but this point is lost somewhere amongst the many plots and twists. It tends to be very odd take on the subject, and I would not really recommend using your time to check it out.\n",

Unfortunately I reckon that the style is weak, words are just thrown without explanesions in the pages, sentences are chopped in a way that often made me feel totally extraneous to the plot.

That's all? So we suffer through all of this to find out that there's a group of people in the country who have memorized books? That's great, books and ideas and free thought live!, but then what in the world was the whole sense of Montag's story leading up to that great revelation?I thought Montag was a little wimpy and the whole chase at the end wasn't exciting.

She changes Montag's opinion on books.I would recommend this book to anyone interested in futuristic books. This book may get a little confusing at points but it makes you think. You wonder what a world without reading would be like and if a world like this could ever exist.\n",

      "Perhaps it is dated. Perhaps it was just built up too much. But this is yet another book that came highly recommended, both by other 'day-to-day' readers and critics alike, that i just could not enjoy.Bradbury's tale of a world where books is banned has a powerful and interesting premise. But it does not seem to follow through for me. Which is a shame - here is a book that is about the importance of books in our lives, but it is so boring that rather than 'get something' out of it, you just come away thinking how boring it is.Or at least i did.\n",

      "I've just finished reading this book and although the premise behind it is intriguing, the books feels unfinished and rushed...Also, Bradbury's elegant and descriptive style of writing feels like a shroud that covers the rather poor character development and lack of interesting characters. This book also needs a large section (that should basically precede the book as it stands now) dedicated towards describing the overall setting and government climate in order to set the proper mood.....Therefore I cannot recommend this title.\n",

      "Now, don't get me wrong: I thought 'Fahrenheit 451' was a pretty good book, but I was very unimpressed by the number of mistakes found in the 165 pages. The name Montag was spelled wrong on several occasions, there are words oftentimes missing from dialogue--or the wrong ones all together--and quotes either missing or in the wrong places, making it oftentimes confusing to read. Editing was either skipped altogether or done by a blind man...one of the two.Overall, though, 'Fahrenheit 451' is an average book. I did not feel connected with any of the characters, and could've cared less what happened to Montag. Clarisse disappeared too early without much reason as to why--I assumed her being hit by a car was false, but apparently not--and the future looks bland to me. Luckily, though, I won't be around to see it.(Also, the &quot;war&quot; seemed tacked on without any real reason as to its existence in the story, save for maybe wiping out the human race so we could start over.)Not a great book. I'm hoping Bradbury has written by stories than this apparent &quot;classic&quot;.\n",

      "In the beginning Kit sails to America to live with her aunt and uncle,from there you follow her through day to day pilgrim life. Kit dislikes the life of the pilgrim; she finds refuge at the house of an old lady at Blackbird Pond. The book does a great job describing the history of this time period which is probably why it won the award.However, I was seriously disapointed with the story itself.One of the main problems being that there is no plot of which to speak. Kit goes the U.S., nothing else happens, FINALLY, at long last the story ends. Also, while I'm sure the author envisioned Kit as a strong willed character, they do not show it very well; also there really isn't any character development either, unless you count the last three pages.Wondering why I chose to read this if I hated it so much? I didn't choose, it was assigned for school reading.Oh yeah, there is no actual \"witch\" of Blackbird Pond (lady, but not witch). So, in conclusion, only read this if you want to die of boredom.\n",

      "The book \"The Witch Of Blackbird Pond\" was a book that I wouldn't read again. The author, Elizabeth George Speare, could not get all the details in a way that could keep my attention, or my imagination running wild. Towards the middle the author made kit seem like a beauty queen, she had about three guys wanting to court her, John Holbrook liked her on the ship along with Nathaniel Eaton. When she finally got to Wethersfield there was a guy named William Ashby was courting her and came to her house after seeing her in the Meeting (church) and then William asked Kits uncle (Mathew Wood.) Although I do not like how magnificent and marvelous the author made Kit Tyler seem, I did like the two characters Prudence and Mercy. Prudence was a little girl that was not allowed to see or speak to Kit Tyler. Prudence's mother thought that Prudence was a child that was too thick or dense to go to school and learn. Mercy was Kit Tyler's cousin. She was crippled. Mercy was a sweet girl that taught small children how to read in her kitchen. I would not recommend this book. It is not very well written for young adults for the 21st century.\n",

Not great and I usually love books about witches for I am very interested in the topic and it is not unusual for I live in Massachusettts and as you know in Salem, Massachusetts was where they hanged witches. But the one flaw in this book was that it was dull and barely talked about Kit meeting up with the witch of blackbird pond and just told about her life basically from the barbadoes and her coming to Conneticut. Second of all the biggest flaw in this book is that the witch hunt took place in Conneticut! Uh! Uh! I don't think so. Conneticut is definetly not a setting for a witch hunt. That is definetly Massachusetts. You may have heard of witch hunts in Conneticut but a few and Massachusetts is of course the homeland for witch hunts in New England.

      "It's not worth one star but I must give it something to register my review. So it is with reluctance that I give it one star.If you want to read a historical fiction book that gives our founders an UGLY and untrue stereotype, THIS is the book for you. It is categorized as imaginary and it certainly is. There is no truth to it and does NOT represent the times it writes about. It is a pity that young people are being exposed to \"historical fiction\" like this.The Puritans were \"strict\" people but with loving hearts. They worked hard and had high moral ideals. Their high standards were Bible based. These two facts repulse people today. The Puritans were also well educated people. In fact they had better educations than kids have today! Puritans were \"prejudiced\" against sinful behavior as we should all be but we aren't in todays society. The oppposite of this is what is endorsed in our society today. Today what is right is wrong and what is wrong is right. You'll get more of the endorsement of what is wrong is right thourgh reading this book. In the near future, I expect authors like this to be writing about the \"social justice\" of Marxism and having kids and adults LOVE it!As an original source historian, it is clear that this author has no knowledge of the time she writes about and is giving kids and \"adults\" a false view of history. The book is slow and often boring. The plot is predictable once you realize that the author HATES any form of Christianity. The author is adamant in getting across her lowly opinion of Quakers and Puritans.I am also not surprised the academic LEFT loved it and awarded it the Yearling Newberry - it helps trash America's beginnings and makes them out of be irrational extremists. Unfortunately that is very much in vogue today. So if you have an axe to grind with Christianity, specifically Puritans and Quakers, you'll love this book! It will feed your hatred of those Christians. It was very disappointing and definitely very BIASED with UGLY inaccurate sterotypes.Homeschoolers - pass on this. It's a waste of time. Yes, it's imaginary all right but using the ugliest of Christian sterotypes to try to keep your attention and hav eyou believe this is how it was in those times - WRONG!\n",

There barely is a plot. I like books where there is a lot of action and the story mountain has bumps along the way. This book, there is no mountain and they just go on flat ground (just to let you know I'm being metaphoric here) and then go up a little hill. The only reason I actually gave this book a star is because the witch trials and where Kit is running away is kind of suspenseful. Just don't read this book it isn't good.\n",

      "A thoughtless and spoiled girl thrusts herself uninvited on her poor relations, then pouts and simmers in hostile resentment over the unintended consequences of her hasty actions. She scorns the virtue and work ethic that give her uncle's family the edge to survive in their harsh colonial environment, shirking her chores and remaining dispirited. Truly, Kit Tyler is a poor example for graciousness, duty, or manners.Time and again, we see Kit run away from her responsibilities, leaving the bulk of the hard work for her lame-in-one-leg cousin. She is too immature to understand the knife's edge her newfound community walks, trying to stave off famine. Only the pitched effort of every able-bodied person can ensure that the crops are planted and tended, the clothing is made and mended, the children are taught to read and write and cipher, the harvest is brought in before the frost. These villagers have no buffer; it is either work now or starve later. Their culture has sprung up as a way to reinforce the discipline and self-control that is needed. Kit is oblivious to these community norms; even the ones that are explained to her she shrugs off as ridiculous.But all is not lost, because there are outsiders in town, and Kit befriends THEM. The service she performs for Hannah and her patient teaching of Prudence make Kit almost likeable. Almost. The townspeople accuse Kit of witchcraft because of her inability to fit in, and finally she realizes the goodness and decency of her uncle's family as they try to shield her from the peril she has brought upon herself.Along the way, Kit gains insight into the beauty of simplicity and order. She feels the exhiliration of the seasonal changes in New England. We rejoice over the love she discovers.Happy ending to a silly book. Good vocabulary, and good for conversations about rushing to judgment.\n",

It is not until almost 200 pages into the book will the subject be touched upon, and then gingerly dropped. Much of the writing is fillers and dribble; this book could have been 100 pages shorter. I didn't care for any of the characters, and all of them were typecast. The angry, strict Uncle, the caring, soft-spoken Aunt, two cousins - one being the flirt and one being sweet.

I guess if you're into olden times, witch hunts, arguments, and \"romance\" I guess it would be fine, but it wasn't my favorite book.I'll just kinda give you a brief telling of what the book is about.It starts out that a girl named Kit is sailing from Barbados which is in the West Indies and is headed to stay with her Aunt and her family in Wethersfield, Connecticut. Then she just is really outof place. She has different customs and just doesn't fit in. Her uncle isn't glad she's there and neither are other important people in the township. It's kinda just a lot of mishaps and bad things happen to Kit. Then she befriends a \"witch\". It's just aboutr her I guess gaining trust and her beginning to fit in.The end was just kinda like \"blah\". It's just kinda like Kit falls of the face of the earth, although wshe does live \"happily ever after\". As most books do unless they're horrors.I think that i8f you just wanted to relax it wasn't a good book to read because you had to thyink about what you were reading. But I guess if you're uptight and like it in books where it says 'tis all the time and thee I guess TWOULD (he he he) be good for you. But if you want to go to sleep you could read it.

      "Overall, I was disappointed with this book. I don't mind long, slow, drawn-out plots as long as they are detailed and developed. By the middle of this book, I wondered when it would get started. By the last quarter of the book, I was still wondering when it would get started. Usually by the end of a book, I feel that I &quot;know&quot; the characters. This book left me feeling empty. The characters Judith and Mercy were poorly developed. I was almost finished with the book before I realized the differences and similarities between Judith and Mercy... I spent most of the book wondering who was who! As for the witch-hunt -- that was also disappointing. Kit and Hannah were not accused outright of being witches until the last three chapters. Only one chapter in the whole book is entirely devoted to the witch-hunt. Finally, at the end of the book, I was left feeling completely empty with Nat and Kit's relationship. It just came out of no where. I had a feeling they would get together in the beginning and I wanted to see them together, but I was really disappointed with the events that led up to it. What can I say positive about this book? It is a good historical fiction of Puritan times and lifestyle. If you are interested in the Puritan ways, you will probably like this book. If you are interested in the witch-hunt or if you want to read a well-developed good book, I would pass on this one.\n",

      "The Witch of Blackbird PondThe Witch of Blackbird Pond by, Elizabeth George Speare, was a novel that took place in Connecticut, around the 1600's. It was about a girl named Kit, who lived in Barbados with her grandfather, but goes on a journey on \"The Dolphin\"( a ship) to Connecticut to live with her Aunt Rachel. Only Kit doesn't tell her aunt that she is coming, because she's afraid of rejection. When she arrives, Kit meets many people such as: Hannah, Nat and more. In Wethersfield it is hard for Kit to find acceptance. Why isn't she accepted by the townspeople?? If this suspenseful question interests you, then this book is definitely for you.For me, this book had good points and bad. I did enjoy the action filled court case, but because I typically don't enjoy books that were supposed to take place along time ago, so this really wasn't my cup of tea!

Some were even creative and said that it is a spellbinding novel of suspense and romance. Most said it is a well written and that they enjoyed the way she formed her characters. In my opinion though, all of these book critics have been embellishing the facts.I agree that it was a well written but nothing so outstanding, so intriguing that I would recommend this book for joy reading. It is hard to believe that over 200,000 hard copies alone have been sold. The plot was very typical, because even sheep could guess what the out come would be in almost all the events. How could the wooly animals do this and there be an ounce of suspense with in the cover of Speare's book.One critic even went as far as to say that the novel was compelling. I wonder if the person making that statement knew that compelling meant: tending to demand attention, how could a book that someone might choose to read to put them to sleep be compelling.Although, this is just my opinion of Speare's book. You might find the book to be as the book critics have said. The book may really be compelling, outstanding, and suspenseful. But if I were you I wouldn't take such a risky chance. A chance that after spending several hours reading the book that you realize that you agree with my opinion.

All that really happens is the girl, Kit meets a lonely old lady who is nice to her. She isn't even a witch. I say that this is the worst book in the world. I think that it's like eating pure cocoa.

      "_The Witch of Blackbird Pond_ is a very entertaing historical-fiction. The time it took place was during the time when the American colonies were being settled. This book was well written and would be great to read for people who love soap operas. There was not a lot of action in this book and no adventure. At times I didn't even want to read the book and other times I was locked on to it. There is some irony in this book and it can get very exciting.

      "The Witch of Blackbird PondWritten by Elizabeth George SpeareThe Witch of Blackbird Pond was a very different book. There were parts in the book than were kind of slow and drug on. I would give this book two stars. Some of the parts that should have been long were very short and not enthralling. One example of this would be the witch trials. I thought that would be thrilling and exciting, but instead it was was short and down to the point. If it would have been more gripping, it would have got a better rate. I didn't like how this book bounced from one spot to another. In some some places you got lost. I didn't like the beginning because it didn't draw me in or keep my attention. She didn't give me much of a physical description of the characters or the setting. The plot was unclear and had many different problems, so it was hard to keep straight what was happening. The ending was a good ending it was probably the best part of the book because everybody got what they wanted. If it would have had more detail and suspense.

I usually like more action filled books like hunting books of murder novels, I just think that they are more interesting.The Witch of Black Bird pond was pretty well written. The author did a good job of trying to make it interesting. There are some people that liked the book a lot but I just wasn't one of them. I also though that the author wrote the book very correct to history with all of the witch hunt stuff. The author did a good job describing and telling the story. I think that if you like romance with a little bit of action in it this is definitely the book for you.Probably one of the reasons that I didn't like it is because it had a witch in it and I don't believe in witches. That made it really hard for me to take seriously. I didn't much care for the names of the characters.

This is possibly the most boring book that I have ever read. Nothing happens! I feel that a lot of people call this book a classic simply because some literary expert happened to like it once, and so these people, in a vain attempt to appear more intelligent than they are, simply churn out someone else's opinion, without actually thinking of their own response to the novel.

      "Modern novels can be so pretentious, with their needless philosophizing and conscious experimentation with the language. So isn't nice to read a classic novel with straight-forward writing that aims for no insight into society or people? Actually no, it's kind of depressing. The Mayor of Casterbridge relies on coincidence, melodrama, and, as the afterword in my edition puts it, &quot;the constant exploitation of chance happenings to determine situation and hence the fate of his characters.&quot; I chose this Hardy novel because it was supposed to be character-centered. The story starts with Michael Henchard selling his wife and child at a fair. I thought this book would examine his redemption, it would be a Lord Jim type tale of profound psychological insight. A strange event like that is a good way to get a book started, but the crazy, unlikely events just keep a-coming. You feel nothing for the characters, ever. You learn nothing in the end, except life is cruel and if something can go wrong, it will. Read something else.\n",

In fact, a better description of this novel comes from a colleague of mine, Professor Neale Scott of the Baltimore University, who remarked &quot;I realise now I had mistaken the dullness of Henchard's character for the dullness of the whole novel.&quot;. Ultimately, Prof. Scott is quite accurate in his assessment of the text. The characters bumble around, waiting for circumstance to attach itself to their groins, and do very little of plausible importance at all. Henchard himself is, without doubt, one of the most irritating characters to be placed in 'classic' fiction, and one can't help but wish that the death of our tragic hero had happened an awful lot sooner, such as before the novel started. The character of Elizabeth-Jane, wonderfully parodied by Helli Kitchin, of the Moscow State University, is so blase towards her constantly changing parenthood that it completely ruins any sense of empathy that the audience may have for her. The least convincing Scotsman ever can also be found in this text, in the form of Donald Farfrae, and I am inclined to agree with Dr Daniel Greenfeld, whose thesis, &quot;Hardy makes the heart grow colder&quot;, points out that the author would not know a Scotsman if one jumped up and bit him, a way that most of us admittedly meet them. To sum up - I discourage my students from reading this shambolic text. Avoid this novel like the plague - it is so soggy, you couldn't even burn it to stay warm. Attempt, perhaps, to read something a little more plausible with something other that a praetorian wanderer and an intransigent hay-trusser to tantalise the imagination, something that the author was obviously lacking - Wessex indeed.\n",

      "\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\" ought to be the model of what a classic is not. Books deemed as a \"classic\" are said to be everlasting and universal in its message. This book does not spread its wings into our era, and it does not apply to everyone in some way, unless you've experienced paternity uncertainty and emotional neglect. The characters are rigid, changing without reason, and lacking practical emotions. Michael Henchard is repulsive from the start, from when he sells his wife and child, to his emotional withdrawal towards the young woman who turned out to be his non-biological daughter, to hiding the truth of who her father actually was to Elizabeth-Jane, so one cannot pity his outcome. Elizabeth-Jane, the non-biological daughter of Henchard, was completely void of personality. \"Blas&eacute;\" has more personality than Elizabeth-Jane. After a tennis match type life, of being flung back and forth between fathers, to marrying Donald Farfrae who one day courted her, married another woman (who just happened to be the landlord of the house Elizabeth-Jane was living at, at the time), and then realized his affection for her, Elizabeth-Jane would've been a prime candidate for therapy (how could she give her heart to men who kept being introduced as her father?), but instead acted as if she was a spokesperson normalcy. Finally, Donald Farfrae, a Scotsman, who was the poster boy for blandness, never really showed growth. He was always monotone, and I could not tell if he found Elizabeth-Jane's biological father to scorn Henchard, or truly help Elizabeth-Jane find the truth. I felt naught for the characters but purposelessness, and the story itself was uncreative and improbable. I do no recommend.\n",

      "John Kerry and his associate Jane Fonda ran the The Vietnam (faux) Veterans Against the War Organization. They were instrumental in helping North Vietnam win the war and turning the tide. North Vietnam was ready to surrender conditionally until Kerry &amp; Fonda rendered their aid.As the American POWs returned home in 1973, they spoke out about the inhumane treatment and torture they had suffered as prisoners of war. Their stories directly contradicted Jane Fonda's earlier statements of 1972.Some of the American POWs such as Senator John McCain, a former Presidential candidate, stated that he was tortured by his guards for refusing to meet with Jane Fonda and her group. Jane Fonda, in her response to these new allegations, referred to the returning POWs as being &quot;hypocrites and liars.&quot;The Wall Street Journal (August 3, 1995) published an interview with Bui Tin who served on the General Staff of the North Vietnam Army and received the unconditional surrender of South Vietnam on April 30, 1975. During the interview Mr. Tin was asked if the American antiwar movement was important to Hanoi's victory.Mr. Tin responded &quot;It was essential to our strategy&quot; referring to the war being fought on two fronts, the Vietnam battlefield and back home in America through the antiwar movement on college campuses and in the city streets. He further stated the North Vietnamese leadership listened to the American evening news broadcasts &quot;to follow the growth of the American antiwar movement.&quot; Visits to Hanoi made by persons such as Jane Fonda, former Attorney General Ramsey Clark and various church ministers &quot;gave us confidence that we should hold on in the face of battlefield reverses.&quot;Mr. Tin surmised that &quot;America lost because of its democracy; through dissent and protest it lost the ability to mobilize a will to win.&quot; Mr. Tin further advised that General Vo Nguyen Giap (Commanding General of the North Vietnam Army) said the 1968 Tet Offensive was a defeat. Gen. Giap in his book, made the same statement, adding that they were surprised by the news media reporting and the demonstrations in America. Instead of seeking a conditional surrender, they would now hold out because America's resolve was weakening and victory could be theirs.From 1969 to the end of the war over 20,000 American soldiers lost their lives in a war that the United States did not have the resolve to win. If General Giap was accurate in his assessment that North Vietnam was going to seek a conditional surrender at the Paris Peace Conference, but stopped due to the sensationalism of the American news media and the anti-war protests following the 1968 Tet Offensive, it follows that those who participated in these anti-war activities have to share partial responsibility for those 20,000 + Americans deaths.We won the war on the battlefield but lost it back home on the college campuses and in the city streets.Americans must realize that there are agents* operating in this Country attempting to undermine our Country and it's leadership through our democratic principles in an effort to achieve a foreign country's goal. A prime example of such a person during the Vietnam War was Jane Fonda, an admitted Socialist, who blatantly supported North Vietnam. * Agent - Any person who works to obtain the goals of another nation either for money or for their own political beliefs.A valuable lesson was taught by North Vietnam to other nations on how the United States may be defeated by fighting a two front war - the battlefield and the American home front. We must be aware of this vulnerability.In 1975, after the fall of the South Vietnam Government, Jane Fonda returned to Hanoi with her newborn son Troy for a celebration in her honor for the work she had done for North Vietnam. During the celebration, her son was christened after a Viet Cong hero, Nguyen Van Troi. Troi had attempted to assassinate Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara while on his visit to South Vietnam in 1963. The South Vietnam Government executed Troi for this attempted assassination.\n",

      "Although cleverly written and interesting to read, I would not recommend this book for a person who is not already well grounded in their knowledge of the faith. I found myself growing in disquiet with every chapter I read. While not directly espousing error, it came sufficiently close to be disturbing. I will give some examples to illustrate:1) Chapter 3 on the Incarnation discusses how the Incarnation shows the essential dignity of man and even quotes Pope John Paul II on this point. Yet the way the point is made comes close to idolizing man - going as far as saying: \"From all eternity God has wanted to be exactly like you and me\" and that this was God's \"secret ambition\". To me, that comes uncomfortably close to saying that God wants to be in our image whereas the bible tells us that we are the ones created in God's image! This is accentuated in Chapter 4 on Salvation when it frames the original sin as the refusal to believe in the goodness of being human. Yes, arguments can be made to explain what the author really means but the risk of misleading the uninitiated is too great in an introductory book!2) Chapter 7 on the Eucharist, goes to great lengths to discuss how the Eucharist brings about the unity of believers who share in the Eucharistic banquet. While this is true, the first and most important aspect of the Eucharist is that it is the re-presentation of Jesus' sacrifice on Calvary. Unfortunately, this essential element is not mentioned. This emphasis on the communion aspect at the expense of the sacrifice aspect drains the Eucharist of its meaning and value.I could have given other examples but these should be enough to make the point. If this is truly your introduction to Catholicism, all I can say is BEWARE. BTW, an irritating trait is the use of 'inclusive language' resulting in ridiculuos sounding expressions like \"God emptied Godself\".\n",

Well nature abhors a vacuum--SOMETHING will come in all right. This \"vacuum\" is the same major fault with trancendental and other New Age meditations.While trying to make God the center of your life/thoughts is admirable, creating a spiritual \"vaccum\" is dangerous.The traditional form of (Christian) meditation is rather to concentrate on something positive--God Himself through the mysteries in His revealed Word. There is never any vacuum created with its concomitant dangers.The Rosary is an excellent way to accomplish this tradional Christian meditation--by meditating on God directly through the Gospel mysteries. This is far better, less dangerous and spirtually more profitable, than emptying one's self and hoping that what fills the resultant vacuum is good rather than evil.Although the author is probably well-intentioned, I fear this book might mislead some, or get others into trouble.

Note quote marks are the authors work, breaks in between are my comments.\"So great was the preference given to sacred over profane learning that Christianity had been in existence fifteen hundred years, and had not produced a single astronomer.\" Oh, really? Pope Sylvester II (1000's), Johannes de Sacrobosco (1200's), Nicole Oresme (1300's), and Nicholas of Cusa (1400's) would disagree and they were just a few Catholic CLERIC Astronomers.\"Copernicus, a Prussian,...\" and Catholic Cannon (I wonder if the author knew and left this out or just never came across this bit of info) \"Aware that his doctrines were totally opposed to revealed truth...\" and could not be proved scientifically \"refrained from publishing his book for 36 years...[until] the entreaty of Cardinal Schomberg.\" Well, at least he admitted that we owe a Cardinal the publishing of this book. Although it was banned, as far as I can tell it wasn't until 100 years after his death with and that mostly due to Galileo's personality conflict with certain church authorities.\"[Waxing poetic about Galileo noting a couple of astronomical phenomena] and many other beautiful telescopic discoveries tended to the establishment of the truth of the Copernican system.\" While they were indeed evidence for it, it still was not scientifically provable. For Copernicus still used spherical orbits and his system was no better than the Ptolemaic one at predicting the motions, which is what a scientific theory is supposed to do.\"By the low and ignorant ecclesiastics...\" and noted scientists like Tycho Brahe \"...they were denounced as deceptions or frauds.\" Now for the Evil Church attacks poor noble Galileo (conveniently leaving out how he insulted the pope...of course being insulted does not justify the actions of any man, but this author is so driven by an agenda that he has made Galileo a saint.) \"He was then committed to prison\" otherwise known as house arrest in his villa.The author picks and chooses bits of facts, distorts and lies to create a blatant anti-Christian screed and anyone who thinks otherwise is smoking something. I studied Astrophysics and am a faithful Catholic. There have been many, MANY Catholic scientists who have made notable contributions to their fields of study.

Perhaps even worse, there is more than a bit of religious propaganda that sneaks its way into the text, without the author ever denoting it as such.

      "There are two problems with this book: First, its title and introduction lead one to believe that it will be an objective depiction of the anatomy of a conflict. Instead, it is a polemic against Christianity (mostly Roman Catholicism) and an endorsement of Science. Second, although its conspicuous copyrite year is 2010, the book was actually written in the late 19th century.The book presents very detailed historical material of the evolution of science and Christianity from the time of their origins up to the late 1800s, and concludes that Christianity, during most that time, severely hampered the vigor and freedom of scientific inquiry. The essence of the author's thesis is that in trying to explain everything about everything Christianity had, in large part, stepped on ground that would have been better served by observation and experimentation. In its determnation to maintain the upper hand, and in vacating the ideational ground upon which Christ stood, Christianity ultimately killed people, stifled free thinking and stymied the progress of civilization for at least a millenium before the Protestant Reformation. At least the author implies as much.This seems axiomatic from the standpoint of the 21st century and it might be true that Christianity lost its way within a short period after Christ's death. But, in the author's 19th century zeal to extol the virtues of science he omits an examination of what Christianity did accomplish on ground that it rightly stood. For instance, \"Seminal Christianity\" is not designed to be scientific but rather to be interpretive; it's not to explain what the universe is but why it is there; it doesn't speak to the human mind but to the human heart. To paint Chrisitrianity, in general, negatively in contrast to the neoreligion of science might have worked in a culture bathing in the first glow of Darwinism. However, those brush strokes don't impress the modern mind that knows religion and science try to do different things, knows that any religion is not monolithic, notwithstanding the indiscriminate carpet-bombings of Christopher Hitchens, Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, et al. As one tradition steps on the ground of the other, it is wrong.Draper was drunk with the miracles of late 19th century science and was understandably myopic. This reader, by virtue of the times he lives in, is not.\n",

      "Chaucer's Canterbury Tales is a widely discussed collaboration of tales that depict various groups of people in many different assessments. In The Wife of Bath, the portrayal of women is extremely controversial. The question of whether Chaucer was a misogynist or supported women's liberation is a passionately discussed topic. Based upon Chaucer's various portrayals of women, he was not a male chauvinist who desired superiority over women. Chaucer portrayed women through his opinion as an Englishman in Medieval England, where the common view was that women were subordinate to men. This is seen in the Wife of Bath's contradictory personality as well as the characters of her tale.To understand the importance of feminist criticism, it is important to know what it is and stands for. Feminist literary criticism is the term for analyzing literary works through the examination of female points of view, concerns, and values in comparison with the time period and culture. In Mary Wollenstonecraft's A Vindication of the Rights Women, she asserts the observation \"Women, I argue from analogy, are degraded by the same propensity to enjoy the present moment; and, at last, despise the freedom which they have not sufficient virtue to struggle to attain.\" One of the primary purposes of feminist literary criticism is concerned with \"uncovering the contingencies of gender\" as a cultural, social, and political system and instrument of domination. (Jehlen) Meaning, that their goal is uncover any iniquities placed upon women due to cultural setting, political standpoints, or social foundations.Although there are immutable biological differences between men and women, these differences create various social differences in different societies. One society may be completely different than another, at least in their treatment of the separation of gender. Also, in a patriarchal society, such as England in Chaucer's time, the separation of gender involves more than just social differences, but also the idea that sexual differences are the same as sexual inequality (. Rigby) It is inequitable to be judgmental of Chaucer and his views of women, as anti-feministic as they are, because Chaucer was from a completely different social construct and historical time period.Through Chaucer's Wife of Bath, as well as the characters in her tale, he portrays various views of women within Chaucer's time. He represents women as unchaste and unruly in the Wife of Bath, Dame Alice. He also depicts women as helpless and overlooked in the raped maiden of The Wife of Bath's Tale. The queen within the tale is shown as gracious. However, the women questioned by the knight portray a sense of only worldly desire. The old woman shows the wisdom of women, although it seems that she is submitting herself to her husband, she has control over him.His portrayal of Dame Alice is the antithesis of the stereotype for women in Chaucer's time. She was not pure an innocent, as she confessed that \"I won't remain altogether chaste\" Alice was not submissive to each of her husbands, she chose to rule over them. She strikes fear into the town and its parish to the point where she gets and does whatever she wants. The fear and respect the town has for her is seen in lines 459-463 of the General Prologue: \"In all the parish not a dame dared stir, Towards the altar steps in front of her, And if indeed they did, so wrath was she as to be quite put out of charity\" The Wife becomes such a powerful feministic force, at times, by being able to masquerade around town with the qualities and luxuries of being a man and appears to be so happy not following the typical and stereotypical roles set for women at her time and throughout most of history. The Wife of Bath is a zealous woman who freely admits to all the lust, the conniving and the egocentricity that defines her. Dame Alice has radical views about women and their position within a marriage, especially for a time when women were expected to be passive within a marriage. This direct opposition to previously set roles for women is what defines her character.However, the Wife of Bath, while seemingly an example of feminism in all of her qualities, is actually inconsistent with herself.. She is, instead, a mockery of herself. The Wife of Bath is inconsistent in her belief structure. While, at times, she claims to be able to beguile her husbands into doing whatever she wants, creating a view of herself as strong and independent, she often gave into what her husband would want. She freely admits that men are far more intelligent than women appear to be in lines 440-442 of her Prologue \"One of us two must give in, without a doubt; / And since a man is more reasonable/ than woman is, youmust be patient \"Nevertheless, since I know your pleasure I'll satisfy your physical pleasure\". In this quote the Wife of Bath not only concedes that men are more reasonable than women, but also that a good woman and wife will do and give up whatever is necessary for her husband to be satisfied. If the Wife had really been what she appeared to be externally, she would not have admitted that men, in a general stereotype, could contain more reason and intelligence than women could. This quotation leaves an unanswered contradiction about the Wife of Bath. Chaucer easily contradicts the Wife of Bath by showing and telling more personal sides of the Wife of Bath and thus proves her to be much more of a hypocrite and much less of a archaic feminist then originally thought. The Wife also diminishes herself, and all women, by explaining that all women can be bought, in lines 413-417 of her Prologue. \"And Therefore I tell every man this truth,/ Let whoever can, win, for everything is for sale,/ With an empty hand men cannot lure hawks,/ For a price I would endure his lust,/ And make myself a pretend appetite\" The other travelers within The Canterbury Tales also accept her as a rebellion of women's position. The Pardoner requests that the Wife teach them. This also defies biblical and cultural standings on women's positions, as teachers, that they are not to teach over them, as explained in 1 Timothy 2:11-12 of the Judeo-Christian Bible.The Wife of Bath also reverses the roles of Husband and Wife in some of her descriptions of her marriage, as in lines 154-159 of the Wife's Prologue:\"A Husband I will have, I will not desist, / Who shall be both my debtor and my slave, / And have his troubles along with it/ Upon his flesh while I am his wife, / I have the authority all my life/ Over his body and not he\"She is dictating that she will have total control over herself, her husband, and their household, contradictorily to cultural and biblical standards, as discussed by C.S. Lewis in his work `Mere Christianity', \"The function of the husband is to see that this natural preference if hers is not giving its head. He has the last word to protect the other people from the intense family patriotism of the wife\" The Wife sees the relationship between men and women as a battle in which it is crucial to gain the upper hand. She uses tactics, which were seen as the only stereotypical form of defense for women: sexuality, duplicity, and vulnerability. Her armor was indeed necessary. Medieval England presented women as second class citizens, viewed as goods and chattels, with no financial independence. They were often beaten, and it is clearly in the Wife's nature to protect herself. She uses weapons like her sexuality and her youth to make her husbands suffer, so much so that they feel impotent. This weapon was highly effective with first three husbands who she managed to dominate, `But since I had them completely in my hand' and they handed over all of his land and property as she withheld sex in order to get her own way with them.The Wife also used a weapon of deceit and she claims that women have this weapon from birth. She tells her audience that she would deliberately pickarguments and accuse her husbands of the very sins she herself is guilty of, because she admits that attack is the best form of defense. The Wife claims that all the other wives are better treated than herself, and commonly uses her weapon of nagging. She accuses her husbands of being cheap, complaining about extravagance of the neighboring women. She easily attains power over her first three husbands in this way, as they usually submitted for the sake of peace, as she notes, `They were most happy when I spoke fairly to them,/ For God knows I nagged them spitefully./ The Wife ruled over her husbands.The maid in The Wife of Bath was a small character role, and yet her fleeting moment in the story is extremely important. The characteristics of this woman seem to have the ability to go to all women. She is vulnerable and innocent, as she is still a maiden. The only thing known about this woman is that she was overpowered by the knight and severely taken advantage of. \"From which maid at once, in spite of her protests,/ By sheer force he stole her maidenhood\" This example of male domination within a tale is not atypical. Chaucer shows women's weakness in her.In the Queen, Chaucer shows the graciousness of women, as fickle as it might appear. Despite the fact that the Queen knows of the wrongdoing of this man, she begs for his life. It is ironic that she, a woman, is fighting for this man's life after what he had done to another woman.The various women that the knight questioned provide insight as to what Chaucer thought about women. The majority of the answers that the knight acquired were monetary or tangible, such as money, fine clothes, lust, or beauty. Once the idea that women \"take we great delight/ in being considered dependable and trustworthy. / and able to hold steadfastly to one purpose, / and not betray things men tell us\" However, this idea, which was the only virtuous answer was quickly dismissed because it was allegedly \"not worth a rake handle\" It was not plausible for a woman to be considered virtuo\n",

Veblin has found his way back into the mainstream- again. Actually, that's not totally fair- to Veblin that is. Veblin is considered by many to have been an economist in the generally excepted sense of the word. While his &quot;Theory of the Leisure Class&quot; gets the most recognition whenever his name pops up, Veblin was not simply a pamphlet pusher. The same CANNOT be said for Mr. Frank, who, like his intellectual granddaddy K. Galbraith, is fond of playing the armchaired Robin hood. He is, it seems, the intellectual heir to a long line of such poverty pushers. He resurrects the timeless concept of &quot;equal&quot; distribution of income with the same old cliches. This time however, we get to wade through lots of graphs and polls and digitized diatribe that supposedly &quot;prove&quot; Frank's thesis. I loved one reviewers point about Mr. Frank's comparison of a poll taken in america and one taken in Turkey supposedly showing that on average we'd all be happier living as Turkeys than Americans (Yes, I KNOW it's turks!). This sort of poorly constructed logic pervades throughout the book. There are some good sub-sections and some enlightening anecdotes, but I wouldn't buy the book ESPECIALLY if the title attracted you. If anything, the results run contrary to the subtitle: &quot;Why money fails to satisfy in an era of content.&quot; Mr. Frank actually never proves that money dosen't satisfy people, but that it dosen't satisfy the people who he wants to be satisfied.

The only possible reason that I can come up with is that people in 19th century England, did not have things like T.V. and so were absolutely desperate for anything to entertain themselves. This is possibly the most boring book that I have ever read. Nothing happens! I feel that a lot of people call this book a classic simply because some literary expert happened to like it once, and so these people, in a vain attempt to appear more intelligent than they are, simply churn out someone else's opinion, without actually thinking of their own response to the novel. I don't know how many copies of this book have been printed, but it is bound to be a large number, and all I can say is that it is a huge waste of paper which could have been put to better use elsewhere.

      "Modern novels can be so pretentious, with their needless philosophizing and conscious experimentation with the language. So isn't nice to read a classic novel with straight-forward writing that aims for no insight into society or people? Actually no, it's kind of depressing. The Mayor of Casterbridge relies on coincidence, melodrama, and, as the afterword in my edition puts it, &quot;the constant exploitation of chance happenings to determine situation and hence the fate of his characters.&quot; I chose this Hardy novel because it was supposed to be character-centered. The story starts with Michael Henchard selling his wife and child at a fair. I thought this book would examine his redemption, it would be a Lord Jim type tale of profound psychological insight. A strange event like that is a good way to get a book started, but the crazy, unlikely events just keep a-coming. You feel nothing for the characters, ever. You learn nothing in the end, except life is cruel and if something can go wrong, it will. Read something else.\n",

Ultimately, Prof. Scott is quite accurate in his assessment of the text. The characters bumble around, waiting for circumstance to attach itself to their groins, and do very little of plausible importance at all. Henchard himself is, without doubt, one of the most irritating characters to be placed in 'classic' fiction, and one can't help but wish that the death of our tragic hero had happened an awful lot sooner, such as before the novel started. The character of Elizabeth-Jane, wonderfully parodied by Helli Kitchin, of the Moscow State University, is so blase towards her constantly changing parenthood that it completely ruins any sense of empathy that the audience may have for her. The least convincing Scotsman ever can also be found in this text, in the form of Donald Farfrae, and I am inclined to agree with Dr Daniel Greenfeld, whose thesis, &quot;Hardy makes the heart grow colder&quot;, points out that the author would not know a Scotsman if one jumped up and bit him, a way that most of us admittedly meet them. To sum up - I discourage my students from reading this shambolic text. Avoid this novel like the plague - it is so soggy, you couldn't even burn it to stay warm.

      "\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\" ought to be the model of what a classic is not. Books deemed as a \"classic\" are said to be everlasting and universal in its message. This book does not spread its wings into our era, and it does not apply to everyone in some way, unless you've experienced paternity uncertainty and emotional neglect. The characters are rigid, changing without reason, and lacking practical emotions. Michael Henchard is repulsive from the start, from when he sells his wife and child, to his emotional withdrawal towards the young woman who turned out to be his non-biological daughter, to hiding the truth of who her father actually was to Elizabeth-Jane, so one cannot pity his outcome. Elizabeth-Jane, the non-biological daughter of Henchard, was completely void of personality. \"Blas&eacute;\" has more personality than Elizabeth-Jane. After a tennis match type life, of being flung back and forth between fathers, to marrying Donald Farfrae who one day courted her, married another woman (who just happened to be the landlord of the house Elizabeth-Jane was living at, at the time), and then realized his affection for her, Elizabeth-Jane would've been a prime candidate for therapy (how could she give her heart to men who kept being introduced as her father?), but instead acted as if she was a spokesperson normalcy. Finally, Donald Farfrae, a Scotsman, who was the poster boy for blandness, never really showed growth. He was always monotone, and I could not tell if he found Elizabeth-Jane's biological father to scorn Henchard, or truly help Elizabeth-Jane find the truth. I felt naught for the characters but purposelessness, and the story itself was uncreative and improbable. I do no recommend.\n",

Particularly after reading the heartfelt orgin(s) of the book that the author shared in the review he had submitted.I couldn't bring myself to it once I began reading it.Within a dozen pages I had lost interest and was appalled that I had bought this book. I felt that the narrative was both inaccurate and semantically anachronistic. The significance of events were presented with more \"importance\" than they had at the time; Christ's arrival in Jerusalem, and the subsequent chain of events at that Passover, was not the defining moment of the time. It was not the \"JFK assassination\" like event that was burned into everyone's mind. This is implied. Further - word/concepts are presented - by Pontius Pilate- that appear to be coming, conceptually, at least a 1000 - 1500 years too early. It would be like reading a novel about Abraham Lincoln - and having him say , \" that's a cool idea.\" This was very distracting.In general this was not successfully written from the perspective of a powerful 1st century Roman citizen/official -but from that of a devout 20th century Christian - who had excellent idea and good intent- but who didn't know how to get into the head and heart of his intended subject.

Maybe that's because the profoundly stupefying effect that The Viccar of Wakefield by Oliver Goldsmith had on me.The story starts off in a monotone text voice and goes on like that for the entire one hundred ninety nine pages, give or take a few pages depending on version. The story follows a preacher and his family as they fall from grace into poverty. A merchant steals all the money that Viccar Primrose has invested, leaving them poor and forcing them to move out from their home in Wakefield. The book continues and follows the family's trials and tribulations.This book was extraordinarily hard to read, I would not recommend it to anyone that is not a college level English student, and even then only at your own risk. No words are in quotes, the fourth wall is broken constantly, and the main character just preaches what the author thinks about everything. It is probably one of the hardest books I have ever read, and I am a junior English major in college.The characters are amazingly flat, the plot has some redeeming qualities though. The plot shows how the people of the time lived, had fun, and loved; not to mention how mothers regarded their children. The ending though was so... contrived that it ruined whatever interest the main story had.All in all, this story was a waste of time. If you want to learn how things worked in that age, there are plenty of stories that are easier to read, much more accurate, and have less author interruption then this book.

Rasselas (Johnson) and Candide (Voltaire) are much better and worth a look. Meanwhile why bother with a story wherein the hero moves episodically from security through trials to the discovery that happiness and what truths we may grasp lie at home and in the human breast.

      "Just as \"Origin of Species is misunderstood, I believe \"Descent\" to be also, although the latter is a more entertaining read. \"Descent\" fails to concentrate on man without deviating. It is a book of observations and study. It concentrates on how animal life, has, by sexual selection, brought forth the variety in the species we see today, through millions of years. Darwin covered his beloved pigeons in depth in \"Origins\" and continues at length on many other bird species in \"Descent\". I agree with him that all the different types of birds we see today probably came from one ancestor of the pigeon. This is called variation of kind. We see this in just about every living creature and flora. The problem arises when the next step is taken, the rise of one species turning into another (reptile to bird). Throughout the book Darwin does admit to this fact, but he still maintains that it must be, with much difficulty. He does hint to nature having some \"power of thought\", where does this come from? How does nature make these choices? Why did Darwin focus so on the black tribes: their practices, looks, sexuality, if he did not believe them a lower race? Of course he only hints at this, and his belief of evolving from apes is scant, but obvious. Does not the use of race to distinguish only separate? His theory on idiots as somehow lower is also disturbing. And what of the rudimentary parts and vestigial organs. As we progress in our scientific study we understand more on their uses, and there may be much we will never understand. In the end he gives a poor argument, and a convoluted book.There is no doubt there is a tremendous amount of work that went into his book. It is a difficult and painful read, although there are many interesting and detailed observations. One does need to know his enemy. Darwin is not the originator of \"evolution.\" There are many who came before him, since the dawn of time. He was influenced by numerous men of his time, some being more radical. Darwin was nothing new, he just maid it \"hip.\" What he started has turned into the secular humanism the world has adopted. I don't think he meant for this disease to spread like it has. From his writings I understand him as an agnostic, but doubtful. I believed he struggled with the possibly of a deist. It is safe to say it was his only ambition till his dying day to prove \"evolution\" as proof of our existence. What of the missing fossil record?, he new they would be found. He was a confusing man.150 years later and there still has been no intermediate fossils found to prove the case. In fact we are discovering more that validates creation.Why don't we see a scale or a feather erupt occasionally on man? Is it because it is not in our DNA, and never was?The theory of evolution caused Darwin to loose his faith and his experience has been repeated in countless lives. Evolution is an acid that eats away at the mind, a cancer.One only needs to open the pages to Michael Behe's book, \"Darwin's Black Box\", to understand the futility of the evolutionary theory. The engines of life at the molecular level are so complex that there leaves no other possibility than a creator of the universe. There should be no excuse.\n",

Finnegans Wake sort of makes you think in that you have to try to figure out what this word is, or what language this might be, or what Joyce was smoking when he wrote this schlock. What it doesn't do, however, is make you laugh, cry, gasp, grimace, or reminisce like true literature does.Questions for all those that gave this 5 stars: Did you really enjoy reading this? Did it elicit any sort of emotional response out of you? At best it will make you feel smart for recognizing a few foreign words.Honestly, I think Joyce was just a polyglot wordsmith and wrote this as a sort of mental exercise for the same reason people do Sudoku puzzles.

Perhaps it inspires creative thinking/translation from its readers, but nothing of the sort on my part, despite my repeated efforts to sincerely read it.I've read far worse, that's for sure, but someone thinking of dabbling with Joyce for the first time should seriously consider selecting one of his more substantial earlier works, or the frustration with FW may alienate them forever from an otherwise brilliant and often very powerful author.\n",

      "I've read a lot of difficult works - Hegel's Phenomenology, Proust, the Tain, Goethe, Joyce's Ulysses. As difficult and obscure as they were at times, they all had some relative merits. I eventually even found some of them enjoyable on 2nd or 3rd readings (Proust was even enjoyable on the first).This book, on the other hand, is devoid of anything approaching meaning on any level but the most reductionist as an occassional examination of words at play. It's a series of puns and obscurantist references without anything approaching a story or structure or even internal coherency. Of course, what could just as easily be the warblings of a paranoid schizphrenic has been inexplicably hailed by some academics as a masterwork. This is not a masterful examination of language. It's more like the musings of a 6 year old struggling with it who has a taste for bad puns and a serious case of apophenia.If you have finished Joyce other works (which are mostly excellent btw) pick up some Dostoevsky or Proust, Borges, Chesterton, or Calvino. Avoid this book. It's a waste of time.\n",

Portrait, Dubliners, great stuff. Wonderful poetry. He starts to get a bit wonky in Ulysses, but even that is readable (if not altogether understandable - Giffords book is definitely a necessary provision)But why write a book such as the Wake? Didn't he say he thought people would be laughing while reading it?But writing a book noone can understand..He must've been out of his tiny little mind. Couldn't he have written another play, or more short stories about the Eire he loved/despised.It makes no sense to me! Why would anyone want to read what is, basically, a mess. How was this even published? Didn't someone tap him on the shoulder and say, \"Joyce, this makes no sense\"Good grief! Joyce was actually a decent writer to this point!\n",

      "When you get past all the strange words and polyglot puns, Finnegans Wake just isn't that interesting of a book. The ideas expressed are contrived and uninteresting, and many have been already been treated, better, in Ulysses. \"But how do you get past the language?\" is the rejoinder I'm expecting to hear. It's true that very few people understand every word in the book. However I refuse to suscribe to the school of thought that states that FW is a great book just because its hard to understand and nobody will ever \"get\" all of it. Some people have come pretty close- MacHugh's \"Annotations\" goes a long way with individual words, and Campbell's \"Skeleton Key\" well give you the overarching meaning (yes, there is meaning) if you read it with a critical eye. These two books pretty much have FW cracked, end of story.Now many people will also argue that one shouldn't read FW for the meanings or ideas, like other books, but rather that simply the sweet sounds of the language are enough to give it value as a literary object- essentially, even if we don't understand a word, it sounds nice. This is just silly. If you want an auditory experience listen to music or the sounds of nature. If euphonious words is your thing, read some poetry. But for heavens' sakes don't spend the time required to read 680 pages of garbled words simply because they sound cool. My point is that there are already artistic and, in my view, far more enjoyable ways to go about getting a cathartic auditory experience. FW has neither the mellifluosity of The Raven or a Spenserian sonnet, nor obviously can it provide the sonic intensity of a symphony. Books, ultimately, are read for the quality of the ideas they express, and the quality of the style used to express them.The style of FW is idiotic. It was a nice idea at the time, sure, and probably it had to be done when considering the progress of literature as a whole, but these points don't mean that the style is of any aesthetic worth. Most of the words are incomprehensible without some guide, like the \"Annotations.\" Because the difficulty is at the level of words, rather than ideas, one doesn't read FW, one translates it. Joyce uses foreign words (from 60 languages!) and perversions of English as the basis for the vocabulary of the text, and combines and arranges these as he pleases. Now I don't mind foreign language quotes in my books, and I'm as big of a fan of witty word-play as anyone, but when you're essentially inventing a language arbitrarily as you go along you've made a huge and pointless mistake. Why stop at the level of words? Why not write using a whole new alphabet? And the kicker is that the many of the puns are incredibly POINTLESS! A \"bad of winds,\" for example- \"bad\" is Persian for \"wind,\" apparently. So this means what, a \"wind of winds\"? Come on, this is lame! and a far cry from true wit. In another \"celebrated\" passage, Joyce weaves the names of a bunch of rivers into a conversation between two washerwomen. I.e., \"kennet,\" meaning \"ken it\" or \"know it\", and the Kennet river in England. But what's the point? That rivers are cool? That Joyce is cool because he looked up a bunch of river names? That we're cool for figuring them out? Such puerile and mechanical displays of erudition are a waste of time for everyone involved.The common response to attacks on FW's style is that Joyce was attempting to convey the nebulous and polysemous state of dreams. If so he failed miserably. I don't know about the rest of you but I don't dream in portmanteau words- when people talk I know exactly what they're saying. We may not understand why particular things happen in dreams, but at least we know, at a literal level, what is happening (eg. I may not know WHY, in a dream, I'm being chased by a herd of mustachioed ducks wielding blunderbusses, but I can at least describe it as such). FW lacks even that- because of the near-incomprehensibility of the language, it lacks a literal level to start out from.Now all of this could feasibly be tolerable- the translating, the wading through secondary sources, the silliness of a contrived \"dream-language\"- if the payoff was worth it- ie if Joyce was saying something really profound and insightful. If the ideas validated the words. Well, they don't. Underneath it all you just have a cliched quasi-biblical myth with aspirations to allegory. It deals with how one man is Everyman and the whole is contained within its parts and history repeats and cycles are cool and male is destructive and female is fertile. Blah blah blah. Its the world according to Joyce. If you want obsolete notions about the \"nature of man\" and such nonsense, read the Bible or any other religious text. If you would argue that the \"meaning\" isn't the point, please see paragraph two above.FW, depending on who you ask, attempts to do a lot of different things. The problem is that it fails at all of them. As music it is necessarily inadequate, as poetry it is far surpassed by real poetry, as a novel it is incomprehensible, and as a myth or an allegory it is highly derivative and essentially boring. And don't try to sell me those poststructuralist lines about \"foregrounding language\" or \"de-stabilizing the signifier\" either- you know as well as I do that FW doesn't do either of those particularly effectively, and furthermore that those are silly and pretentious concepts to begin with. I love Joyce's earlier works, but Finnegans Wake is just a monstrous waste of time and effort.\n",

      "Finnegans Wake is a mess. If this were not written by James Joyce, would you call it a \"literary classic\"? No--it would belong in the discard pile with lots of red marks on it for lack of basic grammar and sentence structure.There are good stream-of-consciousness novels out there. I read Virginia Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway from cover to cover and it is actually entertaining. Or, at the very least, the sentences actually flow together in the way people would actually speak them.So Finnegans Wake is a dream-like mumbo jumbo. The question is, is there any purpose to it? Why should the reader spend time and effort deciphering the cryptic nonsense in order to figure out what the story actually is, when there are perfectly coherent novels out there that actually tell the story as it is?For one thing, if the author needs to disguise the plot with a ton of fancy language, it just means the plot is too thin to be interesting on its own. Secondly, the English language is perfectly functional. So why break something that's functional to create something that's not?\n",

      "all. After just reading a small portion of Finnegans Wake here on Amazon - thank you for the excerpts because you saved me a bundle - and after flipping through a few pages of Ulysses - too bad I paid full price for the Modern Library Edition - I am now disposed to think that Joyce was the biggest humbug for a writer ever.When I read through the first page of Finnegans Wake, I was quite consternated at my limited vocabulary - I mean, after all, there were something like twenty words - I didn't count - that I didn't know! Which has never happened to me from reading any book, even Melville or Shakespeare! Then I looked some of them up and discovered that they weren't even in the dictionary.Even if some of the words are foreign and actually do exist, this doesn't prove that Joyce was a great writer in English. For a man who was so educated, he sure couldn't compose an original piece of literature with any sort of structural integrity and plot congruency.Scholars would have you believe that Joyce was a genius, whose mastery of the language was invidious. But I query which lingo he conquered, for it surely isn't English.Maybe it was because Melville wrote Moby Dick in one year, or maybe it was because he composed White-Jacket and Redburn in one summer, perhaps Joyce realized his limitations and provinciality of ingenuity, so that's maybe why he foisted Ulysses and Finnegans Wake at the public. In this way he could besot us with \"enigmatic art.\"Some have called Joyce a writer's writer. I wonder if Melville, James, and Dickens would bethinkestit ( hey, I can invent pseudo-words too ) of him of such.\n",

      "Far and away the best thing about this book is the quality of the analysis it has spawned. The book itself is drivel; but the reactions to it form some of the most intelligent and enlightened reviews I have encountered. I have never sprinkled as many \"helpful\" votes within a single site as I have here, to both one-star and five-star appraisals alike.Firstly, the book itself. I cannot subscribe to any of the academic apologias. This book took an interesting concept and stretched it well past the point of absurdity. Like the surrealist movement that ultimately ended up justifying paintings of Campbell's Soup cans, \"Finnegan's Wake\" takes stream-of-subconsciousness to such idiotic lengths that it becomes self-parody.Yes, I have exhaustively analysed the book. I studied it many years ago under the tutelage of an infectiously enthusiastic English professor who dissected its every nuance. Puns, portmanteau constructs, auditory versus literary jabberwocky, dream-state evocation: we analysed all of these elements and more. And for a time, during my \"intellectual\" period, I pretended to admire it. Nowadays, age and--I like to think--wisdom compels honesty: this book is a self-indulgent conceit. Had anyone other than Joyce written it, it would never have been published, much less garnered all the notoriety it has enjoyed over the years.The real value in \"Finnegan's Wake\" has been in the intelligent debate that it has fostered. By stringing together chaotically connected thought fragments, Joyce created the literary equivalent of a star-field: any resulting patterns are a tribute to the richness of the readers' imaginations and not the writer's.Does Joyce's exercise constitute genius? Hardly. Artificial Intelligence research has produced numerous examples of similar jabberwocky constructs, some practically indistinguishable from \"Finnegan's Wake\". So what we have here is a sampling of the peculiarly human ability to impose order upon chaos. Some of these five-star reviews are testaments not to the meaningless jumble that is \"Finnegan's Wake\", but to the creative ingenuity of their authors and to the larger genius of the human imagination.Joyce was not a prolific author, but what he did produce was some of the best writing ever conceived. \"Portrait\", \"Ulysses\", \"Dubliners\": each is a star in the literary firmament. It is natural to try finding a place for his last work in the same firmament, but \"Finnegan's Wake\" doesn't deserve such elevation. This novel was the product of a genius who in the end became so narcissistic and self-absorbed that he dared to pen a scatter-brained homage to his own ego. Would we dismiss this work as vapid nonsense by any other author, it would be dishonest to do otherwise just because that author's name is James Joyce.\n",

      "I admit that I am not qualified to \"judge\" FW. Not because I am stupid, as many 5-star reviewers would assert, I think. I would consider giving up on THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO \"stupid.\" I cannot judge FW as literature because literature is meant to be read, and comprehended. It is not complexity, depth, or any of the like that make this book incomprehensible to me. It is written in its own language. It is its own realm. To judge it would be like judging the writing of an alien civilization. And that is why I gave FW 1 star: it is nonscoreable.This book--FW--seems to be Joyce's joke, or private world, or both. I doubt that any one who claims to love this book has \"got it\" in the sense that Joyce meant it to be understood, either. If one has the perserverance, one will find one's own meaning/pattern in FW, if only because it is human nature to impose order on chaos and...gibberish.FW is certainly fascinating for its complexity of word games. As for the poetic quality of the words? I couldn't speak for that. When a word is over 20 characters long, a mishmash of randomness, I generally stumble like an idiot over every syllable. Thus: it was not fluid. It was not poetic.Yet, for all of its puzzle-like quality, I could not call FW great literature. This is unreadable. Even if one knew all of the languages Joyce was acquainted with, it would still be, I think, unreadable. Joyce was the only one who understood it, and he is dead. I agree, the many interpretations FW has spawned are impressive; but also quite pathetic, if one considers how many scholars spent their lives trying to decipher this.If there is any definite meaning here--any statement Joyce was trying to make--then he failed in conveying it.I'd recommend that anyone who still has any doubts look up FINNEGANS WAKE online--one can find a free online copy.

In 1999 (this is 2005) I started to read the Wake, with the best of intentions, but I soon noticed a problem. A few paragraphs in, my mind would start to wander, for there was nothing solid that my mind could hang on to. I encountered no setting, no characters, no plot, no narration, nothing concrete nor conceptual. The best that I could say was that every once in a while, some group of words would be evocative of an image or memory, but even when this would happen I could not say for certain whether it was intentional on the part of the author or accident. Eventually, I started reading it aloud in order to keep myself \"in\" the book but, no help. Today, I am 100 pages in; I can't really bear to read more than a page at a time, and even this is an effort. I get as close to 'zero' from reading it as I can imagine.Now, please understand that I am not a stupid man, nor unaccustomed to difficult literature. I've a college degree and, in fact, currently teach 10th grade English. I've read (and understood), among other things, Shakespeare, The Bible, War and Peace, and also Ulysses. It is sometimes said that this book was written \"for the intelligensia\"... well... I consider myself part of the intelligensia and this book was not written for me. I am not here trying to argue that the book was written as a joke, or has no actual meaning (though I think those arguments have some merit, when one considers the work) but that a person who picks this up and starts running their eyes over any given page will not be engaging in the same activity as they would when reading a book. The Wake might be closer to some sort of giant puzzle, though I doubt this as well, but a prospective reader should ask himself whether he wants to engage in a 600 page rebus. Further, I doubt that the Wake could have been \"written\" in the same sense that other books are. Am I to imagine that Joyce had a firm intention in mind that guided his decisions in writing this book? That he, say, edited it? Rearranged sentences for impact? Checked for consistency? Is this book translated into other languages? How could it be? And wouldn't that assume that it had been written in some language to begin with. And, finally, if it's not written in English (and it's not), or in any other intelligble language (and it's not), then in what sense do we have a book?Is everything printed on paper literature?I think not. I do not believe that the Wake was written as a book, and I do not think it possible to read it as one, and I submit the book itself as my evidence. It has occured to me that it would be fun, someday, to take some group of people who've given the Wake 5-star reviews, and then test them. Perhaps we could give them a group of five selections, with one of them a faux-passage and four of them authentic FW-Joyce, and see if they could determine the fake? Or, we could provide them with a passage and then ask for an explanation, and them compare their explanations with one another to see if there's any validity. In fact, FW could make for a great party game along the lines of Balderdash.Yes, FW is perhaps (doubtful, though) a rebus and it could, with some imagination, provide a party game of sorts (largely revolving around mockery), but it is not a book to be read. Don't feel bad--it wasn't intended to be read. Through it all, the most interesting thing and the greatest value of the book is to watch the actions of the book's defenders.

However, among the scholars, there is no agreement as to what this book is about, or even if it is about anything, or even if it is readable. To those of us who have enjoyed Joyce's other works, such as Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and The Dubliners, Finnegans Wake is a real disappointment.The book consists of 628 pages of crypticisms, foreign languages, and languages that haven't yet been invented. In those 628 pages one will struggle to find two words that actually go together to form a discernable thought. Of his works, Joyce said, &quot;Ulysees is the day; Finnegans Wake is the night.&quot; Well, I take a lot of walks at night, and even on moonless nights I can make out shapes and shadows, something that is quite impossible in The Wake.No one will ever deny that James Joyce was a brilliant writer. But, it took him 13 years to write Finnegans Wake. If he actually meant to say anything, 13 years is enough time to come up with a way to do so that actually communicates. This book actually seems like Joyce took a set of the Oxford English Dictionary, placed it atop a couple of sticks of dynamite, detonated the dynamite, and walked through the fragments, writing down whatever his failing eyesight was able to pick up. Hence, one is left with the conclusion that Joyce has succeeded in pulling off a hoax, the literary equivalent of the Sokol hoax on the high-brow journal Social Text. And this is what is so disappointing about Finnegans Wake.If you feel that you must read James Joyce (and you should), then by all means, read one of the aforementioned books.

Is it possible I just can't read as well as I've always thought I can?However, I truly think they're just afraid to express their real opinion, after so many have called this thing a work of genius.\n",

      "Real words, unlike what you'd find in this book, cannot describe what you find in here. This book is the bane of my existence. James Joyce must have self-inflicted mercury poisoning in order to write this. The only other plausible explanation is that he became severely mentally retarded from a lack of flow of oxygen to the brain. If you want to actually understand anything, you have to read explanations EVERY \"sentence\". This turns it into a f'n time vampire. It is terrible in every aspect - there are no plot, characters, situations, comedy, horror, storyline, or anything else that books usually consist of. If the author came back to life, became unretarded, and then read his own book again, he would instantly want to drown himself in Lake Michigan. I award him no stars and may God have mercy on his soul.\n",

      "Obviously both and Finnegan proves it. Joyce spent seventeen years on this book, which can be properly read and understood by only one person - James Joyce, who passed away in 1941.Now if you'd like to devote yourself - and perhaps your life - to achieving an understanding of Finnegans Wake, you are certainly free to do so. And, having once attempted to achieve such understanding myself, I can assure you that some of your time will be well spent. But the facts are as follows:1. Joyce was fluent in a number of European languages and had a nodding acquaintance with many more.2. From this knowledge he fashioned a special vocabulary of multilingual blends and puns which he used, with ordinary English syntax, to create the solipsistic discourse of Finnegans Wake. It is, in effect, a private language.3. Since most of his vocabulary is drawn from, and puns on, the languages Joyce was familiar with, the only way one can begin to understand what's happening is to be as familiar with them as James Joyce.4. The entire book is said to narrate the mostly incoherent nighttime dream of its antihero, \"HCE.\" This was Joyce's way of \"getting at\" (whatever that means here) some sort of unconscious European cultural mind - as apprehended and imagined by James Joyce, of course.5. Finnegans Wake is thus basically incomprehensible. The explications in Campbell & Robinson's Skeleton Key, while well informed, are, as the authors admit (though not in these words) the only sense they could make of it with the assistance of a shelf full of reference books. By getting in on the ground floor, C & W effectively dared anyone to disagree. Which would, of course, require another pair of literature Ph.D.'s with another shelf of reference books. There can be more than one interpretation of Finnegans Wake, including a belief in the profitlessness of interpretation.6. Once in a while Joyce can still write a melodious sentence that is close enough to English to carry some meaning. As readers of Dubliners, Portrait of the Artist, and Ulysses are aware, Joyce was at one time a master of poetic English prose. Searching for the poetic moments, and those alone, makes for a pleasant diversion, and will undoubtedly reward the extremely well read and knowledgable.If you're still intrigued, your best bet is to find a copy of the drastically abridged edition with commentary that Anthony Burgess put out forty years ago. Burgess loved Finnegans Wake in the Campbell-Robinson interpretation, and he supplies enough editorial matter to aid you in your innocent quest to believe in Finnegans' greatness. The book may be useful to some as a kind of Rorschach/I Ching for your own creativity: \"How many puns and themes can *I* find?\"This book allegedly turned Derrida into a Deconstructionist. I believe it. Students of OCD and associated disorders should take a look at the entire Finagin Fannomenikonn, if you know what I mean.\n",

This piece of inconsequential nonsense may mean something to James Joyce or 'Neeborg' from the planet 'Zobtreeg', but not to any rational person who doesn't pretend to be intelligent or philosophical.I paid seventeen dollars for a book that is puportedly a 'classic' that discusses all sorts of important issues.

Therefore, I've formulated my OWN little theory about what this book is about: it's about nothing. It's just words that mean nothing, so that people can make whatever they like out of it, and smart people can sound smart and dumb people can listen to them, then transcribe the smart people's words verbatim, and sound smart! That little theory makes just about as much sense as Finnegan's Wake and all of the professing Professors that devote their lives to sounding intelligent, when, ultimately, Finnegan's Wake is just a bunch of nonsense.Don't get me wrong- I'm a nice guy (don't worry- I'm from Australia)\n",

I defy anyone to honestly say that they would have any desire to read further (in fact, I am certain that no one has ever actually read this book).

And the blather about circular design reflects something I recall reading about how Joyce intended the reader to be able to read the book from any point and in any direction with equal felicity. It worked; it's idiotic from start to finish.So what's the end result? Well, you remember that old example that's used to demonstrate the magnitude of infinity--if you set down infinty monkeys in front of infinity typewriters (I suppose now it's computers) eventually one of them types Hamlet. Well, I think it's safe to suppose that in the meantime, they're typing Finnegan's Wake.Now, some folks claim that it should be read for the beauty of it's language alone.

      "I'm going to be politcally incorrect: Finnegan's Wake is a pointless soup of random words and &quot;ideas&quot;, jumbled together in a pseudo-artsy way. I suspect that most people would agree with me in this opinion, but are too afraid to sound &quot;uneducated&quot; by saying so. A cocktail party: &quot;So, you think Finnegan's Wake is hogwash? How...gauche. How naive.&quot;Well, Finnegan's Wake *is* hogwash. I know people have devoted their scholarly &quot;lives&quot; to &quot;translating&quot; this or that or the other passage...what a sad, futile, and pathetic way to devote one's energies!Listen: I have worked as a computer programmer. Instead of &quot;reading&quot; this James Joyce monstrosity, just get 10-15 different foreign language dictionaries, then program your computer to randomly jumble words together. Every few lines or so, make some random allusion to some mythology, or country, or river. You'll get something completely indistinguishable from Finnegan's Wake. (In fact, I've always wanted to arrange a test to see if the average Joyce fan could even tell the difference.)Come to think of it, maybe that's what is so &quot;impressive&quot; about Finnegan's Wake...Joyce had no access to a computer!One pet peeve I have is that everyone assumes that every nonsense word actually has a meaning in some language, and that this was INTENDED by Joyce. Well, that's nonsense. For example, the quote &quot;bad of wind&quot; is supposed to make us shudder with admiration for such a clever author, since (supposedly) &quot;bad&quot; means &quot;wind&quot; in Persian. Ah hah...get it? So clever! What a genius!Well, you know what? &quot;Bad&quot; has meanings in other languages, too, including English. I doubt Joyce knew three words of Persian. My point is that in a collection of random nonsense words as dense as Finnegan's Wake, a HUGE number of randomly selected words and letter-groups will have meanings in SOME language. There are lots of languages out there, folks. Coincidence doesn't make genius.I'm not saying ALL the &quot;puns&quot; are unintentional, but that doesn't mean that Joyce is an artist. He just had the almost unimaginable patience (bordering on obsessive-compulsive) to sit down and string together a densification wordwise palabradesic geoneodiscritization of phonemesis syllabustop and charibdistance to paragramaphone rub dub dub three men in a tubular pregnancy.10 yrs. to write! Egads! Joyce was INSANE.I could write the sequel to Finnegan's Wake in 1 month, with a little help from my PC.By the way, before you dismiss my viewpoint, I will point out that I am one year away from my PhD. Of course, that PhD being in a &quot;hard science&quot; (i.e. physics) will let me be villified by all the &quot;pseudo-scholars&quot; (you know who you are: people who, instead of making their own works of art, devote years of study to someone else's creativity).Anyway, I guess that the purpose of a review is to let someone who has NOT read the work know a little bit about it. Well, I have not read the book in its entirety. I bet the number of people OF ALL TIME who have read the entire book, living or dead, is ZERO. That includes Joyce.

      "I see a plethora of 5-star reviews here for Joyce's opus. I think it is natural to dislike it, however, and I don't think it makes a neanderthal of me because I dislike it too. Look, as a teen I read Thomas Aquinas's Summa Theologica; I struggled through at least half of Sartre's Being and Nothingness, and I've read Chekhov, Dostoevsky, Nietzsche, Kierkegaard and Faulkner. I don't mind struggling with a book if I can mine something from it. FW is too long for such playful babble. I might read a pamphlet of such gobbledegook just for the fun or the exercise of my imagination, but this monster book? I have to feel that Joyce was playing a joke on everyone, or he'd really gone off his rocker. Why should we even bother? I also read Beckett's Waiting for Godot and found that a complete waste of time. My reaction was that it was absurd, but I guess the theatre of the absurd is supposed to be just that. But why bother? I can stand on a crowded street corner and hear trivial chatter as meaningful as Beckett's play. It kind of reminds me of something I saw in an art gallery years ago, during the \"pop art\" craze: a rectangular piece of cardboard, painted with white enamel, mounted on a flat-white background, named, appropriately, \"White Enamel on White.\" Yet it had an inflated price tag, and I did hear a few oohs and ahhs from people behind me. Feeling like a barbarian, I snorted and left the gallery. This is art? And Finnegan's Wake is literature? Please, give me a break.Words that don't communicate are just meaningless black symbols on white paper. What was Joyce trying to communicate? Sure, I can get a kick out of several minutes of it, but then I'm eager to return to the real world. I can't help wondering if the 5-star reviews for FW are written by the same kind of people who sighed over the white cardboard in the gallery, or who find deep meanings in Waiting for Godot. Still, maybe I am a barbarian, and maybe they're of a higher order than I am, so I'm willing to congratulate them for finding gold ore in FW, and wish them happy babbling on their re-read of this inflated classic. Joyce I don't demean, but this FW is a perfect waste of time. If this is literature, then it's at a dead end.\n",

      "Let me preface this review with a disclaimer: Contrary to what some other negative reviewers of Finnegans Wake have done, I make no apologies to those who enjoyed the book for my ensuing critique thereof. I ask for the merit of this review not to be judged by my opinion of the book, but rather by the validity of my case, and its potential helpfulness to those who are interested in reading the book. Without further ado:A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man was my entry point to James Joyce's oeuvre, and it was a brilliant one. As an aspiring writer, I identified every step of the way with Stephen Dedalus' maturation, both as a person and as an author. Joyce's unforgiving treatment of his alter-ego's (i.e., Stephen's) flaws was refreshing, as far too many writers of autobiographical novels (I'm looking at you, Charles Dickens) present overly heroic versions of themselves as protagonists. I then moved on to Ulysses, which proved to be a serious test of endurance and willpower. What I understood of the book I enjoyed; what I didn't understand of it ensured I'd enjoy it even more the second, third, fourth, and who knows how many more times around.Then came Finnegans Wake--I skipped Dubliners at the time, for some odd reason. To call it a \"disappointment\" would be like calling Bernie Madoff \"dishonest\": bluntly put, it was the most regrettable experience of my reading \"career\". I wanted to like the Wake--I swear, I really did. I wanted to brag about how I'd finished the book reputed as the most difficult ever written, and, to boot, ENJOYED it. But it was not to be. I did all I could, short of using a reader's guide, which would have felt like cheating (plus, I'm of the opinion that a book that doesn't make sense without a companion guide doesn't warrant the effort of reading it with one). I read the whole thing aloud to myself, to make sure I'd catch as many of the subtle phonetic easter-eggs Joyce crammed into the work as I could. I spent as many as five minutes on single pages, trying to make sense of it. I noticed textual in-jokes here and there, and paused in self-congratulation at being able to decode them. But all to no avail. The best part of reading the book was when I finished it.I've heard all the arguments in favor of the book's merit. I've known people who profess to have enjoyed Finnegans Wake. I've heard what Harold Bloom's said about it. But it doesn't matter to me. The fact is, if nobody had told me that James Joyce wrote this book, I'd have scoffed at it and never given it a second thought--and quite frankly, I doubt this book would have ever been published in the first place if it hadn't been penned by one of the world's foremost writers. I was able to discern who the characters of the book were--HCE, ALP, et al.--and there were some portions of the book that seemed like vestiges of logic in a massive sea of insanity. I know how much work Joyce put into Finnegans Wake; I know how many people have praised it; I know that every bizarrely construed non-word and multilingual pun was carefully crafted and is not the gibberish it appears to be. But the fact is, this book made for a largely joyless reading experience, and thus I have no choice but to give it 1 star.I won't deny that this book is the work of a genius--sadly, I'm convinced it's that particular genius' weakest effort. Only one person in the world knows all the secrets of the book, and that person, unluckily, died two years after he finished writing it. Perhaps if I knew the intended meaning underlying every single quirk of this book, I'd like it--I guess that's why Joyce considered Finnegans Wake to be his masterpiece, after all.\n",

      "Joyce was quite understandably frustrated when his magnum opus, \"Ulysses,\" did not immediately receive the critical attention he felt it warranted upon its publication in 1922.Thus it was that the artist, while composing his next work, \"Finnegan's Wake,\" got into the habit of periodically banging his head against the typewriter keys, a poignant expression, obviously, of the searing torment boiling within him.Happily for us, the result of these repeated cranial collisions can be viewed in the contents of this volume.\n",

      "Okay, this edition of Finnegans Wake may not exactly be dishonest, but it is disingenuous enough to be seriously misleading. Up front they tell you that the text of the book is taken from the first edition published in May of 1939. This is true, but it doesn't tell the whole story, and most people have no idea what it really means.Finnegans Wake was originally published in 1939. The first edition was replete with errors and typos -- thousands of them. James Joyce spent the last two years of his life (he died in 1941) going through the text correcting the mistakes. An errata list comprising many single-spaced pages was printed in the back of the second edition, and the third edition had all of Joyce's corrections incorporated into the text. So the third edition is the definitive one.But Penguin is reprinting the first edition. Get it? The text you'll be reading will have all of the typos that Joyce spent two years correcting -- uncorrected.Viking does have the third edition of Finnegans Wake in print. It's smaller, with smaller type and not nearly as pretty a cover, but it's the text that Joyce approved. I would get that one (it has a white cover with a green stripe going across the middle of it), and leave this edition alone.\n",

      "As one of the reviewers noted in his review, I too have given many postive marks to those who have given five-star reviews for this novel; because some reviewers have made very good arguments in defense of this novel. [I never give negative marks on anything, even if I don't like a review, but I do give plenty of positives] Therefore, before you begin to throw the bricks and sling your arrows at me, please let me try and explain why I gave this book such low marks. First of all, I have tried to read--or at least decipher \"Finnegans Wake\" on four different occasions. I see from some of the reviews that anyone who attempts to disagree with this novels merits gets pelted with negative marks. For those of you who enjoy this novel, good for you! I do not profess to be as knowledgeable as some of you may be on this books merits. But I DO KNOW WHAT I LIKE! And I did not like this novel.I first tried reading \"Finnegans Wake\" when I was in High School [it was not required reading] because I heard so much about it that I wanted to read something challenging. And challenging was an understatement. Realizing I was young, I attempted it much later while in the military. As if military life were not frustrating enough. It was not until I entered college, where I was reguired to read the novel, that I did so with true earnest: Due to the fact that I had to write an essay on the novel. I did receive an A minus on the paper. However, to be honest, this was after profusely littering the paper with as much b***s***, that to me Joyce littered his novel with. My professor must have seen some great merit in this essay---at least I felt so at the time.However, wanting to truly understand the novel, I decided to REALLY try and capture what Joyce was trying to write. This too led to my dislike of the novel. Not so much with the books difficulty [although that was a problem], but with the simple question: Is it really worth reading? My answer? No! For me a novel has to give me that quality of enjoyment that makes the journey a delightful one. It has to capture my soul! This novel never did capture my soul. Give me unabridged editions [the only ones I read] of \"The Count of Monte Cristo\" by Dumas, \"Les Miserables\" by Hugo, \"War and Peace\" by Tolstoy [once is enough please] and more importantly, my favorite author, Dostoevsky, \"Notes From the Underground,\" \"Crime and Punishment,\" and \"The Brothers Karamazov.\" These novels have given me something back in my life for the efforts that I put into reading them. They were profound and affected me deeply. They ALL gave me something in my life.In conclusion, to those who find this novel worth the high praise it has garnered, I respectfully disagree. There are many great novels from which to choose to spend and evening, afternoon, or morning perusing. And while I do not look negatively on your opinions; if this book gives you enjoyment, then great for you. For me, however, the book gave me nothing. Nor do I wish to spend what little time we are alloted in our short life to spend it on this type of reading. That is my honest opinion. I am sure a 5 star review will give me many positive marks, but that is not why this review exists, or what I am about. This is just my honest opinion.Today I am going to start reading two novels that I have been wanting to read for some time, but have put off until recently. \"Growth of the Soil\", by Knut Hamsun, and \"The Master and Margarita,\" by Mikhail Bulgakov. I hear they are good novels; and after laboring over \"Finnegans Wake\" for too many hours in my life, I will begin to start on that reading list of mine. I'll let you know how these two novels work out. One thing I am pretty sure of, however, is that they will probably not frustrate me as much as \"Finnegans Wake\" did; and in fact, no other novel has been more of a disappointment to me than Joyce's so-called masterpiece.\n",

      "OK, so, yes, some sort of very sophisticated intelligence was involved in this work. No doubt the allusions, multi-lingual puns, and invented words that fill over 600 pages were carefully chosen. But as a whole, or even in small parts, it doesn't make any sense and doesn't yield even to careful analysis and background research.There is no plot, it explains nothing, and it describes nothing coherently. If the goal was to capture the confused, disorganized dream state of a polygot Irish writer then, yes, it's all there on paper. But was an entire book needed for this?The hubris of this undertaking -- and of the literary critics who saved it from obscurity -- can be seen in the condescending introduction to this Penguin edition, where the editor writes:&quot;...any reader can enter Finnegans Wake and find something to absorb him -- as long as he or she doesn't expect to find it all in one place or, complementarily, understand everything else that appears around it. It is even possible to argue, with this same logic, that Finnegans Wake may be more accessible to the common reader that Ulysses -- or, for that matter, War and Peace or Remembrance of Things Past -- since one doesn't have to comprehend it as a totality to profit from it or enjoy it.&quot;In other words, unlike those other books where we read about people, ideas, history, etc. here we can just enjoy the sound and look of random phrases and sentences, the way a baby enjoys pleasant sounding nonsense.The introduction goes on to say, &quot;It can sometimes seem that one is doing well if one makes sense of only a sentence or two on a single page. If, however, one surrenders the need to be master of everything -- or even most things -- in this strange and magnificent book, it will pour forth lots of rewards.&quot;I humbly disagree -- one or two identfiable bits of prose per page is almost by definition an unsatisfactory reading experience. And the estimate of one to sentences per page is high -- after a paragraph or two of incomprehensible invented words, even a few straightforward words or sentences have no context or meaning.I wouldn't discourage people from buying this book, just to see for themselves how weird it is. But I wouldn't say its a good book, anymore than the scholarly yet demented ravings and ramblings of a schizophrenic former PhD student on a streetcorner constitute good oratory. Fascinating, but more worthy of medical and psychiatric scrutiny than literary study.\n",

Just send me twenty bucks and I'll send you the next 600 pages.Here are three words for Joyce that he should have tried to make sense of: Ther-a-py. The guy mave have been great at one point, but he ended up a nut. And this book proves it. And also, since Joyce was such a worshiper of Aristotle's, he should have watched out for the philosopher's famous warning: &quot;No great soul is exempt from a mixture of madness.&quot; True enough, but it is the conquest of that madness, not the surrender to it, which makes a great soul remain so. Joyce, in pitiful fashion, lost the battle, descending from a once eloquent and insightful wordsmith to a full-blown babbling idiot. It's a shame, really.And to all those stuffy professors who like to belittle the layperson by pretending to understand this book, I offer this lucid reproval: ooglebagoogle you jimmenyjammeroos.

      "If I hadnt actually lived in Japan i could see how i could mistake this thing for authoritive, but it amazes me that anyone who has lived out here more than a year could see this as much more than the bag of wind it is. With its pretentious title and lofty quotations of translated haikus, Feiler proves he knows how to make a good impression. The problem is, if you actually read it, you realize he isnt much good at doing anything else.At the time of writing this book, Feiler had been living out here a year as JET highschool teacher (though he doesnt actually admit to that in so many words- to hear him tell it, he was here on &quot;special invite from the japanese goverment&quot;, as if he was some kind of high-ranking diplomat). The title (&quot;Inside the heart of Japan&quot;) and chapter headings (&quot;Drinking alone in rural Japan&quot;, for example), suggest that by reading it you'll gain powerful, poetic realities about this mysterious country. But every chapter left me unsastisfied. He has a habit of starting chapters with an overwritten account of the kind of thing everyone does within a week of being here, and then, when its time to actually say anything, starts quoting press articles off the english language news services wire.

In fact, Michel Haar, a Frenchman, has written an excellent analysis of Nietzsche's philosophical thought called \"Nietzsche and Metaphysics\" which I recommend as a counterbalance to the above mentioned French pop-star-philosopher, byzantine rants and sometimes pornography that Waite and his heroes pummel us with. You can find it on AmazonNietzsche and Metaphysics (Suny Series in Contemporary Continental Philosophy)For a balanced view of Nietzsche's historical setting and political views, I recommend two books. The first, by a historian, is Peter Bergmann'sNietzsche, \"the Last Antipolitical German\"The second examines Nietzsche's political views and is written by a political scientist, Leslie Paul Thiele. It is calledFriedrich Nietzsche and the Politics of the Soul: A Study of Heroic Individualism\n",

The book fails to mention how Kerry smeared Vietnam Vets by calling them all &quot;babykillers&quot; in front of the Senate.Much of Kerry's speech before Congress painted his fellow GIs as so brutal that, today, they could easily be mistaken for Saddam Hussein's Fedayeen killers.He reported to Congress that U.S. soldiers had &quot;personally raped, cut off ears, cut off heads, taped wires from portable telephones to human genitals and turned up the power, cut off limbs, blown up bodies, randomly shot at civilians, razed villages, shot cattle and dogs for fun, poisoned food stocks, and generally ravaged the countryside of South Vietnam.&quot;C. Stewart Forbes, Chief Executive Officer of Colliers International (Kerry's cousin), was awarded a contract worth billions designating Colliers International as the exclusive real estate agent representing Vietnam.Kerry's group, The Vietnam Veterans Against the War Organization, was funded by Jane Fonda.Jane Fonda personally sought out returning American soldiers from Vietnam to solicit them to publicly speak out against American atrocities against Vietnamese women and children during her broadcasts. North Vietnamese officials based in Canada allegedly coordinated her broadcasts.In 1972 Jane Fonda, Tom Hayden and others traveled to North Vietnam to give their support to the North Vietnamese's Government. When she returned to the United States, she advised the news media that all of the American Prisoners of War were being well treated and were not being tortured.As the American POWs returned home in 1973, they spoke out about the inhumane treatment and torture they had suffered as prisoners of war. Their stories directly contradicted Jane Fonda's earlier statements of 1972. Some of the American POWs such as Senator John McCain, a former Presidential candidate, stated that he was tortured by his guards for refusing to meet with Jane Fonda and her group. Jane Fonda, in her response to these new allegations, referred to the returning POWs as being &quot;hypocrites and liars.&quot;The Wall Street Journal (August 3, 1995) published an interview with Bui Tin who served on the General Staff of the North Vietnam Army and received the unconditional surrender of South Vietnam on April 30, 1975. During the interview Mr. Tin was asked if the American antiwar movement was important to Hanoi's victory. Mr. Tin responded &quot;It was essential to our strategy&quot; referring to the war being fought on two fronts, the Vietnam battlefield and back home in America through the antiwar movement on college campuses and in the city streets. He further stated the North Vietnamese leadership listened to the American evening news broadcasts &quot;to follow the growth of the American antiwar movement.&quot; Visits to Hanoi made by persons such as Jane Fonda, former Attorney General Ramsey Clark and various church ministers &quot;gave us confidence that we should hold on in the face of battlefield reverses.&quot; Mr. Tin surmised that &quot;America lost because of its democracy; through dissent and protest it lost the ability to mobilize a will to win.&quot; Mr. Tin further advised that General Vo Nguyen Giap (Commanding General of the North Vietnam Army) said the 1968 Tet Offensive was a defeat. Gen. Giap in his book, made the same statement, adding that they were surprised by the news media reporting and the demonstrations in America. Instead of seeking a conditional surrender, they would now hold out because America's resolve was weakening and victory could be theirs.From 1969 to the end of the war over 20,000 American soldiers lost their lives in a war that the United States did not have the resolve to win. If General Giap was accurate in his assessment that North Vietnam was going to seek a conditional surrender at the Paris Peace Conference, but stopped due to the sensationalism of the American news media and the anti-war protests following the 1968 Tet Offensive, it follows that those who participated in these anti-war activities have to share partial responsibility for those 20,000 + Americans deaths.We won the war on the battlefield but lost it back home on the college campuses and in the city streets.Americans must realize that there are agents* operating in this Country attempting to undermine our Country and it's leadership through our democratic principles in an effort to achieve a foreign country's goal. A prime example of such a person during the Vietnam War was Jane Fonda, an admitted Socialist, who blatantly supported North Vietnam. * Agent - Any person who works to obtain the goals of another nation either for money or for their own political beliefs.A valuable lesson was taught by North Vietnam to other nations on how the United States may be defeated by fighting a two front war - the battlefield and the American home front. We must be aware of this vulnerability.In 1975, after the fall of the South Vietnam Government, Jane Fonda returned to Hanoi with her newborn son Troy for a celebration in her honor for the work she had done for North Vietnam.

The confusion can be summed up in his statement that &quot;analogy&quot; is itself used analogously. Well, if there is not some sense in which &quot;analogy&quot; is used univocally, then &quot;analogy&quot; loses any definite meaning. It becomes simply the night in which all cows are black.
