This repository contains the code and report for the project "Link Analysis for Book Ranking", which focuses on identifying the most central and influential books in the Amazon Books dataset. The project constructs a co-rating graph where books are linked if they are rated by the same users, and applies the PageRank algorithm using Apache Spark and GraphFrames to rank books based on their connectivity.
